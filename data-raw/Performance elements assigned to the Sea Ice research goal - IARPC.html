The following two studies did this in slightly different ways:&lt;br /&gt;Petty, A. A., N. T. Kurtz, R. Kwok, T. Markus, T. A. Neumann (2020), Winter Arctic sea ice thickness from ICESat‐2 freeboards, Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans, 125, e2019JC015764. doi:10.1029/2019JC015764&lt;br /&gt;Abstract&lt;br /&gt;National Aeronautics and Space Administration&#39;s (NASA&#39;s) Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite‐2 (ICESat‐2) mission was launched in September 2018 with the primary goal of monitoring our rapidly changing polar regions. The sole instrument onboard, the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System, is now providing routine, very high‐resolution, surface elevation data across the globe, including the Arctic and Southern oceans. In this study, we demonstrate our new processing chain for converting the along‐track ICESat‐2 sea ice freeboard product (ATL10) into sea ice thickness, focusing our initial efforts on the Arctic Ocean. For this conversion, we primarily make use of snow depth and density data from the NASA Eulerian Snow on Sea Ice Model. The coarse resolution (~100 km) snow data are redistributed onto the high‐resolution (approximately 30&amp;ndash;100 m) ATL10 freeboards using relationships obtained from snow depth and freeboard data collected by NASA&#39;s Operation IceBridge mission. We present regional sea ice thickness distributions and highlight their seasonal evolution through our first winter season of data collection. We include ice thickness uncertainty estimates, while also acknowledging the limitations of these estimates. We generate a gridded monthly thickness product and compare this with various monthly sea ice thickness estimates obtained from European Space Agency&#39;s CryoSat‐2 satellite mission, with ICESat‐2 showing consistently lower thicknesses. Finally, we compare our February/March 2019 thickness estimates to ICESat February/March (19 February to 21 March) 2008 ice thickness estimates using the same input assumptions, which show an ~0.37 m or ~20% thinning across an inner Arctic Ocean domain in this 11‐year time period.&lt;/p&gt;

Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans, 125, e2019JC016008. doi: 10.1029/2019JC016008.&lt;br /&gt;Abstract&lt;br /&gt;We present a first examination of Arctic sea ice snow depth estimates from differencing satellite lidar (ICESat‐2) and radar (CryoSat‐2) freeboards. These estimates cover the period between 14 October 2018 and the end of April 2019. Snow depth is related to freeboard differences by the refractive index/bulk density of the snow layer&amp;mdash;the only free parameter in the approach. Area‐averaged snow depth ranges from 9 cm (on first‐year ice: 5 cm, multiyear ice: 14 cm) in late October to 19 cm (first‐year ice: 17 cm, multiyear ice: 27 cm) in April; on average, this snow is thinner over FYI. Spatial patterns and gradients of snow depth estimates compare well with reconstructions using snowfall from ERA‐Interim and ERA5, although snowfall from ERA5 is systematically higher. For all months, the results suggest that ~50% of the total freeboard is comprised of snow. Retrievals are within a few centimeters of snow depth data acquired by Operation IceBridge in April 2019. Sources of uncertainties associated with this freeboard‐differencing approach are discussed. Further, sea ice thicknesses calculated using the retrieved snow depth and a modified climatology are contrasted. Comparatively, the snow depth and calculated ice thickness using a modified climatology are higher by ~5 cm and 0.33 m, although these differences are not uniform throughout the season. Snow accumulation was slower between October and December but increased between December and January, unlike the modified climatology, which exhibited a monotonic accumulation for all months. Future opportunities for assessment and improvement of these estimates are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also using new roughness metrics from NASA&amp;rsquo;s Operation IceBridge data to improve thickness estimates from ESA&amp;rsquo;s CryoSat-2:&lt;br /&gt;Landy, J. C., A. A. Petty, M. Tsamados &amp;amp; J. C. Stroeve (2020), Sea ice roughness overlooked as a key source of uncertainty in CryoSat‐2 ice freeboard retrievals. Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans, 125, e2019JC015820, doi:10.1029/2019JC015820&lt;br /&gt;Abstract&lt;br /&gt;ESA&#39;s CryoSat‐2 has transformed the way we monitor Arctic sea ice, providing routine measurements of the ice thickness with near basin‐wide coverage. Past studies have shown that uncertainties in the sea ice thickness retrievals can be introduced at several steps of the processing chain, for instance, in the estimation of snow depth, and snow and sea ice densities. Here, we apply a new physical model to CryoSat‐2, which further reveals sea ice surface roughness as a key overlooked feature of the conventional retrieval process. High‐resolution airborne observations demonstrate that snow and sea ice surface topography can be better characterized by a lognormal distribution, which varies based on the ice age and surface roughness within a CryoSat‐2 footprint, than a Gaussian distribution. Based on these observations, we perform a set of simulations for the CryoSat‐2 echo waveform over &amp;ldquo;virtual&amp;rdquo; sea ice surfaces with a range of roughness and radar backscattering configurations. By accounting for the variable roughness, our new lognormal retracker produces sea ice freeboards that compare well with those derived from NASA&#39;s Operation IceBridge airborne data and extends the capability of CryoSat‐2 to profile the thinnest/smoothest sea ice and thickest/roughest ice. Our results indicate that the variable ice surface roughness contributes a systematic uncertainty in sea ice thickness of up to 20% over first‐year ice and 30% over multiyear ice, representing one of the principal sources of pan‐Arctic sea ice thickness uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Leg 4 ICE Team Leader, I successfully coordinated and led a team of&lt;br /&gt;14 sea-ice scientists on the MOSAiC expedition during May &amp;ndash; August 2020.&lt;br /&gt;Snow and sea-ice measurements during PS122 Leg 4 continued the MOSAiC sea-ice program, with the expansion of the optics program and addition of cross-disciplinary activities. These measurements focused on characterizing the following components of the Arctic sea-ice system during the melt season:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Energy budget: solar partitioning in snow and sea ice, heat fluxes &amp;bull; Mass balance: snow, sea ice, and melt pond thickness distributions*, freshwater fluxes &amp;bull; Dynamics: ice motion, deformation &amp;bull; Remote sensing: up-scaling ground measurements to airborne and satellite footprints, validation &amp;bull; Process-oriented system observations: air/snow/ice/ocean physics-biogeochemistry-ecosystem interactions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suite of information from the Arctic melt season will serve as a launching point for improving process-understanding of the Arctic system and components therein, and provide pathways for future model development and improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Specific to my New Investigator Program project, I carried out thickness distribution and optics measurements during Leg 4, collecting time-series data on snow, the surface scattering layer, sea ice, and melt ponds as they evolved over the course of the melt season. These time-series data sets will be invaluable for improving the interpretation and capability of&lt;br /&gt;ICESat-2 data for sea-ice research during the summer melt season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objective: A study was conducted to understand and quantify the importance of cyclones and the timing of sea-ice formation for snow accumulation on Arctic sea ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Identifying the mechanisms controlling the timing and magnitude of snow accumulation on sea ice is crucial for understanding snow&amp;rsquo;s net effect on the surface energy budget and sea ice mass balance. Here, we analyze the role of cyclone activity on the seasonal buildup of snow on Arctic sea ice using model, satellite, and in situ data over 1979&amp;ndash;2016. On average, 44% of the variability in monthly snow accumulation was controlled by cyclone snowfall and 29% by sea-ice freeze-up. However, there were strong spatio-temporal differences. Cyclone snowfall comprised ~50% of total snowfall in the Pacific compared to 83% in the Atlantic.&lt;br /&gt;While cyclones are stronger in the Atlantic, Pacific snow accumulation is more sensitive to cyclone strength. These findings highlight the heterogeneity in atmosphere-snow-ice interactions across the Arctic, and emphasize the need to scrutinize mechanisms governing cyclone activity to better understand their effects on the Arctic snow-ice system with anthropogenic warming.&lt;/p&gt;

The sole instrument onboard, the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System, is now providing routine, very high‐resolution, surface elevation data across the globe, including the Arctic and Southern oceans. In this study, we demonstrate our new processing chain for converting the along‐track ICESat‐2 sea ice freeboard product (ATL10) into sea ice thickness, focusing our initial efforts on the Arctic Ocean. For this conversion, we primarily make use of snow depth and density data from the NASA Eulerian Snow on Sea Ice Model. The coarse resolution (~100 km) snow data are redistributed onto the high‐resolution (approximately 30–100 m) ATL10 freeboards using relationships obtained from snow depth and freeboard data collected by NASA's Operation IceBridge mission. We present regional sea ice thickness distributions and highlight their seasonal evolution through our first winter season of data collection. We include ice thickness uncertainty estimates, while also acknowledging the limitations of these estimates. We generate a gridded monthly thickness product and compare this with various monthly sea ice thickness estimates obtained from European Space Agency's CryoSat‐2 satellite mission, with ICESat‐2 showing consistently lower thicknesses. Finally, we compare our February/March 2019 thickness estimates to ICESat February/March (19 February to 21 March) 2008 ice thickness estimates using the same input assumptions, which show an ~0.37 m or ~20% thinning across an inner Arctic Ocean domain in this 11‐year time period.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: The seasonal evolution of Arctic sea ice can be described by the timing of key dates of sea ice concentration (SIC) change during its annual retreat and advance cycle. Here, we use SICs from a satellite passive microwave climate data record to identify the sea ice dates of opening (DOO), retreat (DOR), advance (DOA), and closing (DOC) and the periods of time between these events. Regional variability in these key dates, periods, and sea ice melt onset and freeze-up dates for 12 Arctic regions during the melt seasons of 1979&amp;ndash;2016 is investigated. We find statistically significant positive trends in the length of the melt season (outer ice-free period) for most of the eastern Arctic, the Bering Sea, and Hudson and Baffin Bays with trends as large as 11.9 d decade&amp;minus;1 observed in the Kara Sea. Trends in the DOR and DOA contribute to statistically significant increases in the length of the open water period for all regions within the Arctic Ocean ranging from 3.9 to 13.8 d decade&amp;minus;1. The length of the ice retreat period (DOR&amp;minus;DOO) ranges from 17.1 d in the Sea of Okhotsk to 41 d in the Greenland Sea. The length of the ice advance period (DOC&amp;minus;DOA) is generally much shorter and ranges from 17.9 to 25.3 d in the Sea of Okhotsk and Greenland Sea, respectively. Additionally, we derive the extent of the seasonal ice zone (SIZ) and find statistically significant negative trends (SIZ is shrinking) in the Sea of Okhotsk, Baffin Bay, Greenland Sea, and Barents Sea regions, which are geographically open to the oceans and influenced by reduced winter sea ice extent. Within regions of the Arctic Ocean, statistically significant positive trends indicate that the extent of the SIZ is expanding as Arctic summer sea ice declines.&lt;/p&gt;" data-action-deadline="" data-action-completed="" data-action-contacts="[]">

&lt;p&gt;Summary points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When coastal leads are open, ice drift becomes less correlated to the wind. Effect of ice mechanics is to enhance ice transport.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no evidence ice is increasing in drift rate because it is weaker in winter. Majority of drift is associated with tensile failure, ice is weak in tension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shape of fractures is suggestive of Mohr-Coulomb type failure. Repeatability of lead patterns suggests pack is isotropic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Future Work: Model repeating lead patterns with ERA interim wind and landfast ice edge as boundary. DEM model to be used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Normal drift patterns are not supportive of ice pack recovery considering the modern extensive SIZ in the Beaufort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arctic Sea Ice Seasonal Climate Indicators from a Satellite Passive Microwave Climate Data Record&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A high quality climate data record of sea ice concentrations from satellite passive microwave observations was used to quantify changes in the Arctic seasonal sea ice cycle. The timing of seasonal sea ice cover changes and the resulting surface albedo changes have major implications for the annual surface energy budget of the sea ice-ocean system. The seasonal evolution of Arctic sea ice can be described by the timing of key dates of sea ice concentration change including the dates of sea ice opening, retreat, advance, and closing. These dates in addition to melt onset and freeze onset dates, also from passive microwave observations, have been used to complete an analysis of temporal changes and variability in the seasonal ice cycle for the years 1979-2016. Results indicate that the melt season and open water season are lengthening at a rate of ~12 days/decade for the Arctic as a whole, with more extreme lengthening of the ice-free periods as large as 30 days/decade locally. The earlier retreat of sea ice allows for the absorption of more solar energy by the ocean, which then delays autumn freeze-up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

The timing of seasonal sea ice cover changes and the resulting surface albedo changes have major implications for the annual surface energy budget of the sea ice-ocean system. The seasonal evolution of Arctic sea ice can be described by the timing of key dates of sea ice concentration change including the dates of sea ice opening, retreat, advance, and closing. These dates in addition to melt onset and freeze onset dates, also from passive microwave observations, have been used to complete an analysis of temporal changes and variability in the seasonal ice cycle for the years 1979-2016. Results indicate that the melt season and open water season are lengthening at a rate of ~12 days/decade for the Arctic as a whole, with more extreme lengthening of the ice-free periods as large as 30 days/decade locally. The earlier retreat of sea ice allows for the absorption of more solar energy by the ocean, which then delays autumn freeze-up.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Related papers:</p>\r\n<p>Peng, G., M. Steele, A. C.

Here, we use SICs from a satellite passive microwave climate data record to identify the sea ice dates of opening (DOO), retreat (DOR), advance (DOA), and closing (DOC) and the periods of time between these events. Regional variability in these key dates, periods, and sea ice melt onset and freeze-up dates for 12 Arctic regions during the melt seasons of 1979&ndash;2016 is investigated. We find statistically significant positive trends in the length of the melt season (outer ice-free period) for most of the eastern Arctic, the Bering Sea, and Hudson and Baffin Bays with trends as large as 11.9 d decade&minus;1 observed in the Kara Sea. Trends in the DOR and DOA contribute to statistically significant increases in the length of the open water period for all regions within the Arctic Ocean ranging from 3.9 to 13.8 d decade&minus;1. The length of the ice retreat period (DOR&minus;DOO) ranges from 17.1 d in the Sea of Okhotsk to 41 d in the Greenland Sea. The length of the ice advance period (DOC&minus;DOA) is generally much shorter and ranges from 17.9 to 25.3 d in the Sea of Okhotsk and Greenland Sea, respectively. Additionally, we derive the extent of the seasonal ice zone (SIZ) and find statistically significant negative trends (SIZ is shrinking) in the Sea of Okhotsk, Baffin Bay, Greenland Sea, and Barents Sea regions, which are geographically open to the oceans and influenced by reduced winter sea ice extent. Within regions of the Arctic Ocean, statistically significant positive trends indicate that the extent of the SIZ is expanding as Arctic summer sea ice declines.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"","completed":"","followupvalue":"","id":2137,"users":[],"followup":null},{"milestone":202,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"October 4, 2019","shortdate":"10/4/2019","datevalue":"20191004","action":"<p><span>Final Report on DoD&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-184\">ONR</abbr><span><span>&nbsp;</span>funded research \"Canada Basin Experiment (CBEX) to Investigate Mechanisms of Sea Ice Thickness Variability and Freshwater Content Changes\".&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/1076033.pdf\">https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/1076033.pdf</a></p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"10/4/2019","completed":"October 4, 2019","followupvalue":"20191004","id":2219,"users":[{"id":2173,"name":"Jennifer Coughlin","link":"/members/people/7199"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","October 4, 2019"]}},{"milestone":202,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"April 29, 2019","shortdate":"4/29/2019","datevalue":"20190429","action":"<p><a href=\"/members/events/12683\"><strong>Sea Ice Meeting April 29th 2019 Meeting</strong></a><strong>(</strong><a href=\"/members/documents/13401\"><strong>Agenda</strong></a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"/members/documents/13470\"><strong>Notes</strong></a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"/members/events/12683\"><strong>Recording</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>Topic:&nbsp;</em>NSF&nbsp;projects focused on Arctic pack ice and<span>&nbsp;</span>landfast<span>&nbsp;</span>ice observations and process studies</li>\r\n<li><em>Presentations:</em>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"/members/documents/13408\">&nbsp;Co-production of<span>&nbsp;</span>shorefast<span>&nbsp;</span>ice knowledge in<span>&nbsp;</span>Uummannaq<span>&nbsp;</span>Bay, Greenland</a>-&nbsp;<a href=\"/members/people/13407\">Amanda Lynch</a>&nbsp;(Brown University)</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"/members/documents/13447\">Improving models of ice drift and deformation: Ice coast interaction</a>-&nbsp;<a href=\"/members/people/745\">Jennifer<span>&nbsp;</span>Hutchings</a>&nbsp;(Oregon State)</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"/members/documents/13356\">AON: Sustained observation and analysis of the Arctic upper ocean<span>&nbsp;</span>thermohaline<span>&nbsp;</span>stratification</a>-&nbsp;<a href=\"/members/people/7752\">John<span>&nbsp;</span>Toole</a>&nbsp;(WHOI)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><em>Highlights:&nbsp;</em>This meeting focused on several&nbsp;NSF&nbsp;projects studying Arctic pack ice and<span>&nbsp;</span>landfast<span>&nbsp;</span>ice observations and process studies.

The sole instrument onboard, the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System, is now providing routine, very high‐resolution, surface elevation data across the globe, including the Arctic and Southern oceans. In this study, we demonstrate our new processing chain for converting the along‐track ICESat‐2 sea ice freeboard product (ATL10) into sea ice thickness, focusing our initial efforts on the Arctic Ocean. For this conversion, we primarily make use of snow depth and density data from the NASA Eulerian Snow on Sea Ice Model. The coarse resolution (~100 km) snow data are redistributed onto the high‐resolution (approximately 30&ndash;100 m) ATL10 freeboards using relationships obtained from snow depth and freeboard data collected by NASA's Operation IceBridge mission. We present regional sea ice thickness distributions and highlight their seasonal evolution through our first winter season of data collection. We include ice thickness uncertainty estimates, while also acknowledging the limitations of these estimates. We generate a gridded monthly thickness product and compare this with various monthly sea ice thickness estimates obtained from European Space Agency's CryoSat‐2 satellite mission, with ICESat‐2 showing consistently lower thicknesses. Finally, we compare our February/March 2019 thickness estimates to ICESat February/March (19 February to 21 March) 2008 ice thickness estimates using the same input assumptions, which show an ~0.37 m or ~20% thinning across an inner Arctic Ocean domain in this 11‐year time period.</p>\r\n<p>Kwok, R., S. Kacimi, M. A. Webster, N. T. Kurtz, &amp; A. A. Petty (2020). Arctic snow depth and sea ice thickness from ICESat‐2 and CryoSat‐2 freeboards: A first examination. Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans, 125, e2019JC016008. doi: 10.1029/2019JC016008.<br />Abstract<br />We present a first examination of Arctic sea ice snow depth estimates from differencing satellite lidar (ICESat‐2) and radar (CryoSat‐2) freeboards. These estimates cover the period between 14 October 2018 and the end of April 2019. Snow depth is related to freeboard differences by the refractive index/bulk density of the snow layer&mdash;the only free parameter in the approach. Area‐averaged snow depth ranges from 9 cm (on first‐year ice: 5 cm, multiyear ice: 14 cm) in late October to 19 cm (first‐year ice: 17 cm, multiyear ice: 27 cm) in April; on average, this snow is thinner over FYI. Spatial patterns and gradients of snow depth estimates compare well with reconstructions using snowfall from ERA‐Interim and ERA5, although snowfall from ERA5 is systematically higher. For all months, the results suggest that ~50% of the total freeboard is comprised of snow. Retrievals are within a few centimeters of snow depth data acquired by Operation IceBridge in April 2019. Sources of uncertainties associated with this freeboard‐differencing approach are discussed. Further, sea ice thicknesses calculated using the retrieved snow depth and a modified climatology are contrasted. Comparatively, the snow depth and calculated ice thickness using a modified climatology are higher by ~5 cm and 0.33 m, although these differences are not uniform throughout the season. Snow accumulation was slower between October and December but increased between December and January, unlike the modified climatology, which exhibited a monotonic accumulation for all months. Future opportunities for assessment and improvement of these estimates are discussed.</p>\r\n<p>Also using new roughness metrics from NASA&rsquo;s Operation IceBridge data to improve thickness estimates from ESA&rsquo;s CryoSat-2:<br />Landy, J.

Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans, 125, e2019JC015820, doi:10.1029/2019JC015820<br />Abstract<br />ESA's CryoSat‐2 has transformed the way we monitor Arctic sea ice, providing routine measurements of the ice thickness with near basin‐wide coverage. Past studies have shown that uncertainties in the sea ice thickness retrievals can be introduced at several steps of the processing chain, for instance, in the estimation of snow depth, and snow and sea ice densities. Here, we apply a new physical model to CryoSat‐2, which further reveals sea ice surface roughness as a key overlooked feature of the conventional retrieval process. High‐resolution airborne observations demonstrate that snow and sea ice surface topography can be better characterized by a lognormal distribution, which varies based on the ice age and surface roughness within a CryoSat‐2 footprint, than a Gaussian distribution. Based on these observations, we perform a set of simulations for the CryoSat‐2 echo waveform over &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; sea ice surfaces with a range of roughness and radar backscattering configurations. By accounting for the variable roughness, our new lognormal retracker produces sea ice freeboards that compare well with those derived from NASA's Operation IceBridge airborne data and extends the capability of CryoSat‐2 to profile the thinnest/smoothest sea ice and thickest/roughest ice. Our results indicate that the variable ice surface roughness contributes a systematic uncertainty in sea ice thickness of up to 20% over first‐year ice and 30% over multiyear ice, representing one of the principal sources of pan‐Arctic sea ice thickness uncertainty.</p>\r\n<p>Walt Meier provided:<br />CryoSat-2 sea ice thickness estiamtes from the NASA data product (https://nsidc.org/data/RDEFT4) have been added to the NASA-funded Arctic Sea Ice News and Analysis tools page: https://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/sea-ice-tools/.

The data are currently available at NASA Goddard, but are planned to be distributed through the NASA Snow and Ice DAAC at NSIDC. In collaboration with University of Colorado post-doc Sang-Moo Lee, a new methodology has been developed to derived sea ice freeboard and thickness estimates from passive microwave data.

Here, we analyze the role of cyclone activity on the seasonal buildup of snow on Arctic sea ice using model, satellite, and in situ data over 1979&ndash;2016. On average, 44% of the variability in monthly snow accumulation was controlled by cyclone snowfall and 29% by sea-ice freeze-up. However, there were strong spatio-temporal differences. Cyclone snowfall comprised ~50% of total snowfall in the Pacific compared to 83% in the Atlantic.<br />While cyclones are stronger in the Atlantic, Pacific snow accumulation is more sensitive to cyclone strength. These findings highlight the heterogeneity in atmosphere-snow-ice interactions across the Arctic, and emphasize the need to scrutinize mechanisms governing cyclone activity to better understand their effects on the Arctic snow-ice system with anthropogenic warming.</p>\r\n<p>NASA&nbsp;previously posted in an update:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>NASA-funded researchers published the following paper in Nature Communications in November 2019: Webster, M.A., Parker, C., Boisvert, L. et al.

In Release 1 and 2 of the ICESat-2 sea ice products, candidate height segments used to estimate the reference sea surface height for freeboard calculations included two surface types: specular and smooth dark leads. We found that the uncorrected photon rates, used as proxies of surface reflectance, are attenuated due to clouds resulting in the potential misclassification of sea ice as dark leads, biasing the reference sea surface height relative to those derived from the more reliable specular returns. This results in higher reference sea surface heights and lowering estimated ice freeboards. Resolution of available cloud flags from the ICESat-2 atmosphere data product are too coarse to provide useful filtering at the lead segment scale. In Release 3, we have modified the surface reference finding algorithm so that only specular leads are used. The consequence of this change can be seen in the freeboard composites of the Arctic and Southern Ocean. Broadly, coverages have decreased by ~10&ndash;20&thinsp;% because there are fewer leads (by excluding the dark leads), and the composite means have increased by 0&ndash;4&thinsp;cm because of the use of more consistent specular leads.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"","completed":"","followupvalue":"","id":2520,"users":[],"followup":null}];

The SVP-Bs were provided by the Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC).5) August, September 2018: 3 AXIBs, 1 Ice Trackers using a&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-238&quot;&gt;USCG&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;C-130.6) Summer 2018: 2 XIBs, 8 SVP-Bs using CGC Healy cruises.7) Summer 2018: 8 SVP-Bs using RV Polarstern.8) Summer 2018: 8 SVP-Bs, 2 UpTempOs using NABOS cruise. We had also planned to deploy 10 SVP-B s from Russian Ice Breakers during the summer of 2018, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t get permits for these buoys in time to deploy them. We have since obtained the permits to deploy these in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far in 2019, the USIABP deployed:1) March 2019: 3 Ice Trackers, 1 Sidekick (webcam), and 1 Ice Pelican (barometer,&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-222&quot;&gt;SST&lt;/abbr&gt;) by the Arctic Submarine Laboratory.2) March 2019: 3 new Scalable Polar Ice Trackers (SPIT) developed by the USIABP, and 1 ECCC Ice Ball on fast ice north of Tuktoyaktuk and Pelly Island, Canada with the support of Canadian Forces. We had also planned to deploy 2 more SVP-Bs and 1 IMB on the drift ice using RCAF Twin Otters, but the sea ice in range of Inuvik, Canada was too thin to land on.3) April 2019: 3 SVP-Bs, 2 SPITs on Fast Ice north of Utqiagvik, Alaska. We will also be deploying 2 prototype Ice Mass Balance buoys developed by Cy Keener at the University of Maryland in collaboration with the USIABP.4) April 2019: 2 SVP-Bs, and 2 SPITs on Fast Ice north of Utqia&amp;fnof;&amp;deg;vik, Alaska. We deployed 2 prototype Ice Mass Balance buoys developed by Cy Keener at the University of Maryland in collaboration with the USIABP.5) June 2019: 3 AXIB, 9 ECCC SVP-Bs using RDAF C-130 coordinated by USIABP as part of ICE-PPR. Our plans for the remainder of 2019 summer season include:1) Summer 2019: 2 DAMPs developed by USIABP, and 20 SVP-Bs using CGC Healy and other ships; 10 SVP-Bs w/ drogues in the Bering Sea during transits, and 10 SVP-B w/o drogues and 3 DAMPs in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas during science cruises.2) September or October 2019: 3 AXIBs, 3 Ice Trackers, 1 ICEXAIR using&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-238&quot;&gt;USCG&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;C-130.3) Summer 2019: 10 SVP-B using Russian Ice Breakers in the Eurasian sector. We also cover satellite telemetry costs for Alfred Wegener Institute (&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-333&quot;&gt;AWI&lt;/abbr&gt;) buoys deployed in the Arctic and Antarctic from 2018 &amp;ndash; 2019. In brief,&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-333&quot;&gt;AWI&lt;/abbr&gt;&amp;rsquo;s funding can buy buoys, but not pay for satellite telemetry costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of September 4, 2019, there are 129 buoys that the USIABP either purchased, deployed or covers satellite telemetry for in the network of 149&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-453&quot;&gt;IABP&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;buoys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some additional activities related activites follow from Ignatius Rigor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Sea Ice Drift Forecast Experiment (SIDFEx, 2017&amp;ndash;2020)The SIDFEx is a community effort to collect and analyze Arctic sea ice drift forecasts at lead times from days to a year, based on arbitrary methods, for a number of sea-ice buoys and, ultimately, research icebreaker Polarstern, on a regular basis.SIDFEx is motivated in part by the need to determine an optimal deployment position of the research icebreaker Polarstern when she will start her year-long drift across the Arctic in autumn 2019 (Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate &amp;ndash;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-151&quot;&gt;MOSAiC&lt;/abbr&gt;; http://www.mosaicobservatory.org). Specifically, it is unclear whether forecast systems that account for initial conditions and provide forecasts of the evolving atmosphere, ice, and ocean system, can provide additional skill over drift forecasts made using historical sea-ice velocity fields. The&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-151&quot;&gt;MOSAiC&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;drift provides a template for assessing the capabilities to forecast sea-ice drift for a range of applications, ranging from logistics support for future field experiments to potential search and rescue operations. The examination of sea-ice drift forecasts provides an integrated assessment of many aspects of the coupled atmosphere-ice-ocean system and will motivate in depth investigations into how key variables are measured, modelled, and forecast. In particular, we expect coordinated drift forecasts to draw attention to the interaction between sea-ice physics and boundary layer physics in both atmosphere and ocean. We expect that a systematic assessment of real drift forecasting capabilities will improve our physical understanding of sea-ice and enable us to identify and resolve model shortcomings and identify limits of predictability.SIDFEx is largely the result of discussions held at various meetings, in particular in the context of the Year of Polar Prediction (&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-248&quot;&gt;YOPP&lt;/abbr&gt;),&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-151&quot;&gt;MOSAiC&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;(http://www.mosaicobservatory.org), the Sea Ice Prediction Network (&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-213&quot;&gt;SIPN&lt;/abbr&gt;; https://www.arcus.org/sipn), the Forum of Arctic Modelling and Observations Synthesis (&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-100&quot;&gt;FAMOS&lt;/abbr&gt;; http://famosarctic.com/index.html), and the International Arctic Buoy Programme (&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-453&quot;&gt;IABP&lt;/abbr&gt;; http://iabp.apl.washington.edu/SIDFEX.html).3) Arctic Observations Experiment (AOX)We deployed the AOX buoy test site in Barrow, Alaska in March 2013 at the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-77&quot;&gt;DOE&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-40&quot;&gt;ARM&lt;/abbr&gt;) site (which is also next to the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-167&quot;&gt;NOAA&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Climate Reference Network site). The AOX test site has 15 buoys that represent the typical instruments that the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-453&quot;&gt;IABP&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;routinely deploys on the Arctic Ocean. We originally planned to deploy this for one year, but are now thinking of maintaining the site indefinitely to test other instruments that the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-453&quot;&gt;IABP&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;and&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-33&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-431&quot;&gt;AON&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;may use in the polar regions.4) Collaboration and coordination with In Situ, Aerial and satellite surveysWe have been working with the NRL DISTANCE,&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Operation Ice Bridge (OIB),&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;GLAWEX, and other researchers. The in situ, and aerial surveys by the projects provide logistics to deploy our buoys, and in turn, our buoys provide markers that they can track as their survey lines drift across the Arctic Ocean. The positions of these and other&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-453&quot;&gt;IABP&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;buoys are also provided to the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-489&quot;&gt;USGS&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;so these pieces of sea ice may be tracked for the Global Fiducials Library (GFL, http://gfl.usgs.gov/index.shtml). Melinda Webster, a former graduate student in Physical Oceanography here at the UW, and now a Scientist at&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Goddard, has been analyzing these buoy observations, OIB data, and GFL imagery for her dissertation research on snow and the evolution of melt ponds (e.g. Webster et al. 2014 and 2015).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What opportunities for training and professional development did the project provide?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this period, Evan Hochwalt, an undergraduate in Applied Physics at the University of Washington has been working with us to explore and develop cheaper weather stations based on Arduino and other microelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How were the results disseminated to communities of interest?&lt;/p&gt;

And we are currently reformatting our databases from 1979 &amp;ndash; present into netCDF.&lt;/p&gt;

The SVP-Bs were provided by the Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC).5) August, September 2018: 3 AXIBs, 1 Ice Trackers using a<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-238">USCG</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>C-130.6) Summer 2018: 2 XIBs, 8 SVP-Bs using CGC Healy cruises.7) Summer 2018: 8 SVP-Bs using RV Polarstern.8) Summer 2018: 8 SVP-Bs, 2 UpTempOs using NABOS cruise. We had also planned to deploy 10 SVP-B s from Russian Ice Breakers during the summer of 2018, but we didn’t get permits for these buoys in time to deploy them. We have since obtained the permits to deploy these in 2019.</p>
<p>So far in 2019, the USIABP deployed:1) March 2019: 3 Ice Trackers, 1 Sidekick (webcam), and 1 Ice Pelican (barometer,<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-222">SST</abbr>) by the Arctic Submarine Laboratory.2) March 2019: 3 new Scalable Polar Ice Trackers (SPIT) developed by the USIABP, and 1 ECCC Ice Ball on fast ice north of Tuktoyaktuk and Pelly Island, Canada with the support of Canadian Forces. We had also planned to deploy 2 more SVP-Bs and 1 IMB on the drift ice using RCAF Twin Otters, but the sea ice in range of Inuvik, Canada was too thin to land on.3) April 2019: 3 SVP-Bs, 2 SPITs on Fast Ice north of Utqiagvik, Alaska. We will also be deploying 2 prototype Ice Mass Balance buoys developed by Cy Keener at the University of Maryland in collaboration with the USIABP.4) April 2019: 2 SVP-Bs, and 2 SPITs on Fast Ice north of Utqiaƒ°vik, Alaska.

Our plans for the remainder of 2019 summer season include:1) Summer 2019: 2 DAMPs developed by USIABP, and 20 SVP-Bs using CGC Healy and other ships; 10 SVP-Bs w/ drogues in the Bering Sea during transits, and 10 SVP-B w/o drogues and 3 DAMPs in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas during science cruises.2) September or October 2019: 3 AXIBs, 3 Ice Trackers, 1 ICEXAIR using<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-238">USCG</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>C-130.3) Summer 2019: 10 SVP-B using Russian Ice Breakers in the Eurasian sector. We also cover satellite telemetry costs for Alfred Wegener Institute (<abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-333">AWI</abbr>) buoys deployed in the Arctic and Antarctic from 2018 – 2019. In brief,<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-333">AWI</abbr>’s funding can buy buoys, but not pay for satellite telemetry costs.</p>
<p>As of September 4, 2019, there are 129 buoys that the USIABP either purchased, deployed or covers satellite telemetry for in the network of 149<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-453">IABP</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>buoys.</p>
<p>Some additional activities related activites follow from Ignatius Rigor:</p>
<p>2) Sea Ice Drift Forecast Experiment (SIDFEx, 2017–2020)The SIDFEx is a community effort to collect and analyze Arctic sea ice drift forecasts at lead times from days to a year, based on arbitrary methods, for a number of sea-ice buoys and, ultimately, research icebreaker Polarstern, on a regular basis.SIDFEx is motivated in part by the need to determine an optimal deployment position of the research icebreaker Polarstern when she will start her year-long drift across the Arctic in autumn 2019 (Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate –<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-151">MOSAiC</abbr>; http://www.mosaicobservatory.org). Specifically, it is unclear whether forecast systems that account for initial conditions and provide forecasts of the evolving atmosphere, ice, and ocean system, can provide additional skill over drift forecasts made using historical sea-ice velocity fields. The<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-151">MOSAiC</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>drift provides a template for assessing the capabilities to forecast sea-ice drift for a range of applications, ranging from logistics support for future field experiments to potential search and rescue operations. The examination of sea-ice drift forecasts provides an integrated assessment of many aspects of the coupled atmosphere-ice-ocean system and will motivate in depth investigations into how key variables are measured, modelled, and forecast. In particular, we expect coordinated drift forecasts to draw attention to the interaction between sea-ice physics and boundary layer physics in both atmosphere and ocean. We expect that a systematic assessment of real drift forecasting capabilities will improve our physical understanding of sea-ice and enable us to identify and resolve model shortcomings and identify limits of predictability.SIDFEx is largely the result of discussions held at various meetings, in particular in the context of the Year of Polar Prediction (<abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-248">YOPP</abbr>),<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-151">MOSAiC</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>(http://www.mosaicobservatory.org), the Sea Ice Prediction Network (<abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-213">SIPN</abbr>; https://www.arcus.org/sipn), the Forum of Arctic Modelling and Observations Synthesis (<abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-100">FAMOS</abbr>; http://famosarctic.com/index.html), and the International Arctic Buoy Programme (<abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-453">IABP</abbr>; http://iabp.apl.washington.edu/SIDFEX.html).3) Arctic Observations Experiment (AOX)We deployed the AOX buoy test site in Barrow, Alaska in March 2013 at the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-77">DOE</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (<abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-40">ARM</abbr>) site (which is also next to the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-167">NOAA</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>Climate Reference Network site). The AOX test site has 15 buoys that represent the typical instruments that the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-453">IABP</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>routinely deploys on the Arctic Ocean. We originally planned to deploy this for one year, but are now thinking of maintaining the site indefinitely to test other instruments that the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-453">IABP</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-33"><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-431">AON</abbr></abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>may use in the polar regions.4) Collaboration and coordination with In Situ, Aerial and satellite surveysWe have been working with the NRL DISTANCE,<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-155">NASA</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>Operation Ice Bridge (OIB),<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-155">NASA</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>GLAWEX, and other researchers. The in situ, and aerial surveys by the projects provide logistics to deploy our buoys, and in turn, our buoys provide markers that they can track as their survey lines drift across the Arctic Ocean. The positions of these and other<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-453">IABP</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>buoys are also provided to the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-489">USGS</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>so these pieces of sea ice may be tracked for the Global Fiducials Library (GFL, http://gfl.usgs.gov/index.shtml). Melinda Webster, a former graduate student in Physical Oceanography here at the UW, and now a Scientist at<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-155">NASA</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>Goddard, has been analyzing these buoy observations, OIB data, and GFL imagery for her dissertation research on snow and the evolution of melt ponds (e.g. Webster et al. 2014 and 2015).</p>

<p>The observations from the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-453">IABP</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>have been essential for: 1.) Monitoring Arctic and global climate change (many of the changes in Arctic climate were first observed or explained using data from the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-453">IABP</abbr>); 2.) Forecasting weather and sea ice conditions; 3.) Forcing, assimilation and validation of global weather and climate models; 4.) Validation of satellite derived estimates of sea ice motion, surface temperature, sea ice thickness, etc.Since the inception of this project over 1000 papers have been published using data produced by this grant.

&lt;p&gt;In 2017 and so far in 2018, we have deployed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2 CALIBs and 1 Ice Tracker with the NRL DISTANCE project in the Beaufort Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2 SVP-B buoys with the Arctic Submarine Labs mini-&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-399&quot;&gt;ICEX&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;efforts in the Beaufort Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 9 SVPs in the Bering and Chukchi Seas, deployed by the Norseman 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 4 SVP-Bs deployed by the CCG Sir Wilfrid Laurier in the Canadian Beaufort Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 8 SVP-Bs deployed by the CGC Healy in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 3 AXIBs owned by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) were deployed by USIABP personel from a Royal Danish Air Force flying from Thule, to the high Arctic (Fig. 2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10)3 USIABP AXIBs and 1 Ice Tracker were deployed using a Royal Canadian Air Force C-130, in addition to 14 SVP-B buoys purchased by the ECCC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also shipped 10 SVP-B buoys to Kirkenes, Norway to be deployed during the NABOS cruise in September/October 2017 which has been cancelled. These buoys are now in storage at the Alfred Wegener Institute, Germany, and will be deployed this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-453&quot;&gt;IABP&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;currently has 118 buoys reporting in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the buoy purchases and deployment logistics described above, this grant also partially funds the coordination of the entire&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-453&quot;&gt;IABP&lt;/abbr&gt;. All the Arctic buoys are purchased and deployed using a combination of equipment and logistics coordinated with collaborators of the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-453&quot;&gt;IABP&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We deployed the AOX buoy test site in Barrow, Alaska in March 2013 at the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-77&quot;&gt;DOE&lt;/abbr&gt;Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-40&quot;&gt;ARM&lt;/abbr&gt;) site (which is also next to the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-167&quot;&gt;NOAA&lt;/abbr&gt;Climate Reference Network site). The AOX test site has 15 buoys that represent the typical instruments that the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-453&quot;&gt;IABP&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;routinely deploys on the Arctic Ocean. We originally planned to deploy this for one year, but are now thinking of maintaining the site through March 2017 to test other instruments that the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-453&quot;&gt;IABP&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;and&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-33&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-431&quot;&gt;AON&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;may use in the polar regions .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FUTURE PLANS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deployment Plans for 2018.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Arctic, we currently have 6 AXIBs, 2 XIBs and 20 SVPs that we plan to deploy during summer and fall of 2018 from aircraft and ice breakers. We will deploy these buoys primarily using similar logistical assets as we have used for the past few years. Specifically, for details please see http://iabp.apl.washington.edu/overview_deploymentplans.html.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 CALIBs and 1 Ice Tracker with the NRL DISTANCE project in the Beaufort Sea.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 SVP-B buoys with the Arctic Submarine Labs mini-<abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-399">ICEX</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>efforts in the Beaufort Sea.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-111">GPS</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>trackers with adventurers traversing to the North Pole from Barneo.</p>
<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 ICEAIR and 1 SVP north of Deadhorse in the Beaufort Sea in collaboration with<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-177">NSF</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>funded Warming and iRadiance Measurement (WARM) buoy project.</p>
<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 SVP-Bs in the Bering and Chukchi Seas by<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-194" data-hasqtip="3">R/V</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>Siquliaq.</p>
<p>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9 SVPs in the Bering and Chukchi Seas, deployed by the Norseman 2.</p>
<p>7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 SVP-Bs deployed by the CCG Sir Wilfrid Laurier in the Canadian Beaufort Sea.</p>
<p>8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8 SVP-Bs deployed by the CGC Healy in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas.</p>
<p>9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 AXIBs owned by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) were deployed by USIABP personel from a Royal Danish Air Force flying from Thule, to the high Arctic (Fig. 2)</p>
<p>10)3 USIABP AXIBs and 1 Ice Tracker were deployed using a Royal Canadian Air Force C-130, in addition to 14 SVP-B buoys purchased by the ECCC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also shipped 10 SVP-B buoys to Kirkenes, Norway to be deployed during the NABOS cruise in September/October 2017 which has been cancelled. These buoys are now in storage at the Alfred Wegener Institute, Germany, and will be deployed this summer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-453">IABP</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>currently has 118 buoys reporting in the Arctic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-453">IABP</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>Coordination</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the buoy purchases and deployment logistics described above, this grant also partially funds the coordination of the entire<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-453">IABP</abbr>. All the Arctic buoys are purchased and deployed using a combination of equipment and logistics coordinated with collaborators of the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-453">IABP</abbr>.</p>
<p><strong>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>Arctic Observations Experiment (AOX)</strong></p>
<p>We deployed the AOX buoy test site in Barrow, Alaska in March 2013 at the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-77">DOE</abbr>Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (<abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-40">ARM</abbr>) site (which is also next to the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-167">NOAA</abbr>Climate Reference Network site). The AOX test site has 15 buoys that represent the typical instruments that the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-453">IABP</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>routinely deploys on the Arctic Ocean. We originally planned to deploy this for one year, but are now thinking of maintaining the site through March 2017 to test other instruments that the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-453">IABP</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-33"><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-431">AON</abbr></abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>may use in the polar regions .</p>
<p><strong>FUTURE PLANS</strong></p>
<p><strong>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>Deployment Plans for 2018.</strong></p>
<p>For the Arctic, we currently have 6 AXIBs, 2 XIBs and 20 SVPs that we plan to deploy during summer and fall of 2018 from aircraft and ice breakers. We will deploy these buoys primarily using similar logistical assets as we have used for the past few years. Specifically, for details please see http://iabp.apl.washington.edu/overview_deploymentplans.html.</p>

We also cover satellite telemetry costs for Alfred Wegener Institute (<abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-333\">AWI</abbr>) buoys deployed in the Arctic and Antarctic from 2018 &ndash; 2019. In brief,<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-333\">AWI</abbr>&rsquo;s funding can buy buoys, but not pay for satellite telemetry costs.</p>\r\n<p>As of September 4, 2019, there are 129 buoys that the USIABP either purchased, deployed or covers satellite telemetry for in the network of 149<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-453\">IABP</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>buoys.</p>\r\n<p>Some additional activities related activites follow from Ignatius Rigor:</p>\r\n<p>2) Sea Ice Drift Forecast Experiment (SIDFEx, 2017&ndash;2020)The SIDFEx is a community effort to collect and analyze Arctic sea ice drift forecasts at lead times from days to a year, based on arbitrary methods, for a number of sea-ice buoys and, ultimately, research icebreaker Polarstern, on a regular basis.SIDFEx is motivated in part by the need to determine an optimal deployment position of the research icebreaker Polarstern when she will start her year-long drift across the Arctic in autumn 2019 (Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate &ndash;<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-151\">MOSAiC</abbr>; http://www.mosaicobservatory.org). Specifically, it is unclear whether forecast systems that account for initial conditions and provide forecasts of the evolving atmosphere, ice, and ocean system, can provide additional skill over drift forecasts made using historical sea-ice velocity fields. The<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-151\">MOSAiC</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>drift provides a template for assessing the capabilities to forecast sea-ice drift for a range of applications, ranging from logistics support for future field experiments to potential search and rescue operations. The examination of sea-ice drift forecasts provides an integrated assessment of many aspects of the coupled atmosphere-ice-ocean system and will motivate in depth investigations into how key variables are measured, modelled, and forecast. In particular, we expect coordinated drift forecasts to draw attention to the interaction between sea-ice physics and boundary layer physics in both atmosphere and ocean. We expect that a systematic assessment of real drift forecasting capabilities will improve our physical understanding of sea-ice and enable us to identify and resolve model shortcomings and identify limits of predictability.SIDFEx is largely the result of discussions held at various meetings, in particular in the context of the Year of Polar Prediction (<abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-248\">YOPP</abbr>),<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-151\">MOSAiC</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>(http://www.mosaicobservatory.org), the Sea Ice Prediction Network (<abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-213\">SIPN</abbr>; https://www.arcus.org/sipn), the Forum of Arctic Modelling and Observations Synthesis (<abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-100\">FAMOS</abbr>; http://famosarctic.com/index.html), and the International Arctic Buoy Programme (<abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-453\">IABP</abbr>; http://iabp.apl.washington.edu/SIDFEX.html).3) Arctic Observations Experiment (AOX)We deployed the AOX buoy test site in Barrow, Alaska in March 2013 at the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-77\">DOE</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (<abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-40\">ARM</abbr>) site (which is also next to the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-167\">NOAA</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>Climate Reference Network site).

IceBridge studies annual changes in thickness of sea ice, glaciers and ice sheets. IceBridge bridges the gap between the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-125&quot;&gt;ICESat&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;missions.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;is planning to continue OIB through FY20. In April and May of 2019,&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;&amp;rsquo;s Operation IceBridge (OIB) completed its final Arctic spring airborne campaign onboard Wallops Flight Facility&amp;rsquo;s (WFF) P-3 Orion aircraft (N426NA). More than 35 personnel &amp;ndash; mostly from WFF, Goddard Space Flight Center, The University of Kansas and the U.S. Navy &amp;ndash; participated in this campaign to survey changing ice across the Greenland Ice Sheet, ice caps in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and sea ice in the Arctic Ocean. This Arctic airborne campaign was the first to underfly&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-125&quot; data-hasqtip=&quot;3&quot;&gt;ICESat&lt;/abbr&gt;-2,&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;&amp;rsquo;s newest satellite laser altimeter, following its launch in September 2018. A key focus of this campaign was to underfly&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-125&quot;&gt;ICESat&lt;/abbr&gt;-2&amp;rsquo;s laser beams, so that its performance and geolocation could be assessed relative to longer-heritage OIB instruments, including WFF&amp;rsquo;s Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) laser altimeters. This campaign included numerous zero- and low-latency underflights of the satellite, which required daily re-planning of many missions. In the case of sea ice, which can drift hundreds of meters per hour in parts of the Arctic Ocean, we again measured local winds to correct for drift between the time of the satellite overflight and our underpass, so that the same ice floes could be surveyed. In total, we flew more than 21,000 kilometers of&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-125&quot;&gt;ICESat&lt;/abbr&gt;-2 ground tracks with latencies of seconds to hours between the aircraft and satellite over fast-drifting sea ice. The instrument suite included the usual OIB contingent of laser altimeters, radar sounders and nadir imagers, with nearly all instruments reporting excellent data collection throughout the campaign.Although shorter than previous Arctic spring campaigns, the OIB team nevertheless completed 24 science missions (both land ice and sea ice) in less than 7 weeks, again basing out of Thule Air Base in northwestern Greenland and later in Kangerlussuaq in southwestern Greenland. Weather primarily favored surveys of northeastern and southwestern Greenland, and shutdown-related delays in the campaign start meant that cloudier conditions were more often prevalent in the Arctic Ocean, making for challenging mission selection over sea ice. The weather even conspired to force OIB&amp;rsquo;s first-ever divert, from Thule Air Base to Kangerlussuaq, but we were able to return to Thule Air Base after only a single overnight. This last OIB campaign onboard this larger aircraft included our last major media visit, which was from a BBC video production crew filming Frozen Planet II while based in Kangerlussuaq. We also again corresponded with K-12 students from around the world, reaching nearly 500 during the course of the campaign.Since September 2, 2019 Operation IceBridge has been based out of Thule Greenland conducting science flights during the melt season. This is the first time both ATM lasers and the KU snow radar are both flown during the melt season.

In April and May of 2019,<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-155">NASA</abbr>’s Operation IceBridge (OIB) completed its final Arctic spring airborne campaign onboard Wallops Flight Facility’s (WFF) P-3 Orion aircraft (N426NA). More than 35 personnel – mostly from WFF, Goddard Space Flight Center, The University of Kansas and the U.S. Navy – participated in this campaign to survey changing ice across the Greenland Ice Sheet, ice caps in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and sea ice in the Arctic Ocean. This Arctic airborne campaign was the first to underfly<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-125" data-hasqtip="3">ICESat</abbr>-2,<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-155">NASA</abbr>’s newest satellite laser altimeter, following its launch in September 2018. A key focus of this campaign was to underfly<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-125">ICESat</abbr>-2’s laser beams, so that its performance and geolocation could be assessed relative to longer-heritage OIB instruments, including WFF’s Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) laser altimeters. This campaign included numerous zero- and low-latency underflights of the satellite, which required daily re-planning of many missions. In the case of sea ice, which can drift hundreds of meters per hour in parts of the Arctic Ocean, we again measured local winds to correct for drift between the time of the satellite overflight and our underpass, so that the same ice floes could be surveyed. In total, we flew more than 21,000 kilometers of<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-125">ICESat</abbr>-2 ground tracks with latencies of seconds to hours between the aircraft and satellite over fast-drifting sea ice. The instrument suite included the usual OIB contingent of laser altimeters, radar sounders and nadir imagers, with nearly all instruments reporting excellent data collection throughout the campaign.Although shorter than previous Arctic spring campaigns, the OIB team nevertheless completed 24 science missions (both land ice and sea ice) in less than 7 weeks, again basing out of Thule Air Base in northwestern Greenland and later in Kangerlussuaq in southwestern Greenland. Weather primarily favored surveys of northeastern and southwestern Greenland, and shutdown-related delays in the campaign start meant that cloudier conditions were more often prevalent in the Arctic Ocean, making for challenging mission selection over sea ice. The weather even conspired to force OIB’s first-ever divert, from Thule Air Base to Kangerlussuaq, but we were able to return to Thule Air Base after only a single overnight. This last OIB campaign onboard this larger aircraft included our last major media visit, which was from a BBC video production crew filming Frozen Planet II while based in Kangerlussuaq. We also again corresponded with K-12 students from around the world, reaching nearly 500 during the course of the campaign.Since September 2, 2019 Operation IceBridge has been based out of Thule Greenland conducting science flights during the melt season. This is the first time both ATM lasers and the KU snow radar are both flown during the melt season.

Surveys of the Arctic sea ice began with a series of flights on March 22 from Thule, Greenland, transitioning to Fairbanks, Alaska, and then back to Thule, Greenland to finish up the sea ice missions on April 16. Due to some unfortunate aircraft issues with<span>&nbsp;</span></span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\">NASA</abbr><span>&rsquo;s P-3 Orion and a hard deadline for the P-3 to return to<span>&nbsp;</span></span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\">NASA</abbr><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Wallops Flight Facility for another airborne mission, OIB was not able to return to Longyearbyen, Svalbard to resurvey the Eurasian sea ice like it had previously in 2017. Regardless of these issues, OIB was able to complete 8 sea ice missions, and 12 land ice missions during the duration of the campaign, which ended on May 4, 2018. The majority of the baseline missions for both sea ice and land ice were achieved. &nbsp;During this spring campaign, OIB collaborated with international and domestic missions: underflights with the European Space Agency&rsquo;s (</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-94\">ESA</abbr><span>) Sentinel-3A and CryoSat-2 satellites, and an overflight of the U.S. Navy&rsquo;s<span>&nbsp;</span></span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-399\">ICEX</abbr><span><span>&nbsp;</span>camp. Like last year, out of Fairbanks, Alaska, OIB was able to continue its expansion westward, re-surveying the western side of the Chukchi Sea, again crossing the International Date Line. OIB was also able to complete a repeat mission surveying sea ice at the North Pole. This year, following a polynya that opened up in February north of Greenland, due to an extreme warm cyclone event, OIB flew a mission over the sea ice there to measure the thickness of the newly formed ice after the polynya closed up. This region was of particular interest because this was the first time in the ice concentration satellite record that a polynya opened up in that location in February, so it was important to measure the thickness of the ice to determine how quickly the ice grew back after the polynya had opened.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"9/27/2018","completed":"September 27, 2018","followupvalue":"20180927","id":1818,"users":[{"id":279,"name":"Christine Mataya","link":"/members/people/286"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","September 27, 2018"]}},{"milestone":276,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"October 4, 2019","shortdate":"10/4/2019","datevalue":"20191004","action":"<p>Final Operation IceBridge 2019 Arctic Spring Campaign</p>\r\n<p>Contributed by:Joe MacGregor, Linette Boisvert, Brooke Medley and Eugenia De Marco<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\" data-hasqtip=\"2\">NASA</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>Operation IceBridge Project Science Office</p>\r\n<p>Using a fleet of research aircraft,<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\">NASA</abbr>&rsquo;s Operation IceBridge images Earth's polar ice to better understand connections between polar regions and the global climate system.

In April and May of 2019,<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\">NASA</abbr>&rsquo;s Operation IceBridge (OIB) completed its final Arctic spring airborne campaign onboard Wallops Flight Facility&rsquo;s (WFF) P-3 Orion aircraft (N426NA). More than 35 personnel &ndash; mostly from WFF, Goddard Space Flight Center, The University of Kansas and the U.S. Navy &ndash; participated in this campaign to survey changing ice across the Greenland Ice Sheet, ice caps in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and sea ice in the Arctic Ocean. This Arctic airborne campaign was the first to underfly<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-125\" data-hasqtip=\"3\">ICESat</abbr>-2,<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\">NASA</abbr>&rsquo;s newest satellite laser altimeter, following its launch in September 2018. A key focus of this campaign was to underfly<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-125\">ICESat</abbr>-2&rsquo;s laser beams, so that its performance and geolocation could be assessed relative to longer-heritage OIB instruments, including WFF&rsquo;s Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) laser altimeters. This campaign included numerous zero- and low-latency underflights of the satellite, which required daily re-planning of many missions. In the case of sea ice, which can drift hundreds of meters per hour in parts of the Arctic Ocean, we again measured local winds to correct for drift between the time of the satellite overflight and our underpass, so that the same ice floes could be surveyed. In total, we flew more than 21,000 kilometers of<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-125\">ICESat</abbr>-2 ground tracks with latencies of seconds to hours between the aircraft and satellite over fast-drifting sea ice. The instrument suite included the usual OIB contingent of laser altimeters, radar sounders and nadir imagers, with nearly all instruments reporting excellent data collection throughout the campaign.Although shorter than previous Arctic spring campaigns, the OIB team nevertheless completed 24 science missions (both land ice and sea ice) in less than 7 weeks, again basing out of Thule Air Base in northwestern Greenland and later in Kangerlussuaq in southwestern Greenland. Weather primarily favored surveys of northeastern and southwestern Greenland, and shutdown-related delays in the campaign start meant that cloudier conditions were more often prevalent in the Arctic Ocean, making for challenging mission selection over sea ice. The weather even conspired to force OIB&rsquo;s first-ever divert, from Thule Air Base to Kangerlussuaq, but we were able to return to Thule Air Base after only a single overnight. This last OIB campaign onboard this larger aircraft included our last major media visit, which was from a BBC video production crew filming Frozen Planet II while based in Kangerlussuaq. We also again corresponded with K-12 students from around the world, reaching nearly 500 during the course of the campaign.Since September 2, 2019 Operation IceBridge has been based out of Thule Greenland conducting science flights during the melt season. This is the first time both ATM lasers and the KU snow radar are both flown during the melt season. Under flights of<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-125\">ICESat</abbr>-2 have also been achieved at low latencies.

Data were firstpublished in Petty et al., 2020 with a link to code and methodology at https://github.com/akpetty/ICESat-2-sea-ice-thickness.Further sea ice thickness results were also published in Kwok et al., 2020. Petty,A. A., Kurtz, N. T., Kwok, R., Markus, T., &amp;amp; Neumann, T. A. (2020). WinterArctic Sea Ice Thickness From ICESat‐2 Freeboards. Journalof Geophysical Research: Oceans, 125(5), e2019JC015764.AbstractNational Aeronauticsand Space Administration&#39;s (NASA&#39;s) Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite‐2 (ICESat‐2) mission was launched in September 2018 with the primary goal of monitoring our rapidly changing polar regions. The soleinstrument onboard, the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System, is nowproviding routine, very high‐resolution, surface elevation data across theglobe, including the Arctic and Southern oceans. In this study, we demonstrateour new processing chain for converting the along‐track ICESat‐2 sea ice freeboard product (ATL10) into sea ice thickness,focusing our initial efforts on the Arctic Ocean. For this conversion, weprimarily make use of snow depth and density data from the NASA Eulerian Snowon Sea Ice Model. The coarse resolution (~100 km) snow data areredistributed onto the high‐resolution (approximately 30&amp;ndash;100 m) ATL10freeboards using relationships obtained from snow depth and freeboard datacollected by NASA&#39;s Operation IceBridge mission. We present regional sea icethickness distributions and highlight their seasonal evolution through ourfirst winter season of data collection. We include ice thickness uncertaintyestimates, while also acknowledging the limitations of these estimates.

Finally, we compare our February/March 2019 thicknessestimates to ICESat February/March (19 February to 21 March) 2008 ice thicknessestimates using the same input assumptions, which show an ~0.37 m or ~20%thinning across an inner Arctic Ocean domain in this 11‐year time period.

Journal of Geophysical Research:Oceans, 125(3), e2019JC016008.AbstractWe present a firstexamination of Arctic sea ice snow depth estimates from differencing satellitelidar (ICESat‐2) and radar (CryoSat‐2) freeboards. These estimates cover theperiod between 14 October 2018 and the end of April 2019. Snow depth is relatedto freeboard differences by the refractive index/bulk density of the snowlayer&amp;mdash;the only free parameter in the approach. Area‐averaged snow depth ranges from 9 cm (on first‐year ice: 5 cm, multiyear ice: 14 cm) in late Octoberto 19 cm (first‐year ice: 17 cm, multiyear ice: 27 cm)in April; on average, this snow is thinner over FYI. Spatial patterns andgradients of snow depth estimates compare well with reconstructions usingsnowfall from ERA‐Interim and ERA5, although snowfall from ERA5is systematically higher. For all months, the results suggest that ~50% of thetotal freeboard is comprised of snow. Retrievals are within a few centimetersof snow depth data acquired by Operation IceBridge in April 2019. Sources ofuncertainties associated with this freeboard‐differencing approachare discussed. Further, sea ice thicknesses calculated using the retrieved snowdepth and a modified climatology are contrasted. Comparatively, the snow depthand calculated ice thickness using a modified climatology are higher by~5 cm and 0.33 m, although these differences are not uniformthroughout the season. Snow accumulation was slower between October andDecember but increased between December and January, unlike the modified climatology,which exhibited a monotonic accumulation for all months.

Our data reveal patterns likely linked to competing climateprocesses: Ice loss from coastal Greenland (increased surface melt), Antarcticice shelves (increased ocean melting), and Greenland and Antarctic outletglaciers (dynamic response to ocean melting) was partially compensated by massgains over ice sheet interiors (increased snow accumulation). Losses outpacedgains, with grounded-ice loss from Greenland (200 billion tonnes per year) andAntarctica (118 billion tonnes per year) contributing 14 millimeters to sealevel. Mass lost from West Antarctica&amp;rsquo;s ice shelves accounted for more than 30%of that region&amp;rsquo;s total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refining the sea surface identification approach for determining freeboards in the ICESat-2 sea ice products &lt;br /&gt;Ron Kwok, Alek A. Petty, Marco Bagnardi, Nathan T. Kurtz, Glenn F. Cunningham, and Alvaro Ivanoff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract. In Release 1 and 2 of the ICESat-2 sea ice products, candidate height segments used to estimate the reference sea surface height for freeboard calculations included two surface types: specular and smooth dark leads. We found that the uncorrected photon rates, used as proxies of surface reflectance, are attenuated due to clouds resulting in the potential misclassification of sea ice as dark leads, biasing the reference sea surface height relative to those derived from the more reliable specular returns. This results in higher reference sea surface heights and lowering estimated ice freeboards. Resolution of available cloud flags from the ICESat-2 atmosphere data product are too coarse to provide useful filtering at the lead segment scale. In Release 3, we have modified the surface reference finding algorithm so that only specular leads are used. The consequence of this change can be seen in the freeboard composites of the Arctic and Southern Ocean. Broadly, coverages have decreased by ~10&amp;ndash;20&amp;thinsp;% because there are fewer leads (by excluding the dark leads), and the composite means have increased by 0&amp;ndash;4&amp;thinsp;cm because of the use of more consistent specular leads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract From the onset of melt in early June, corresponding declines in Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite‐2 (ICESat‐2) freeboard and surface albedo can be seen over the entire Arctic sea ice cover. In the 2019 summer, area‐averaged freeboard decreased from 34 cm prior to melt to a minimum of 12 cm in August while the area‐averaged albedo decreased from ~0.7 to 0.38 for the same period. Calculations using ICESat‐2 freeboards and modeled ice thickness from Pan‐Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) give area‐averaged snow depths ranging from 17 cm prior to melt to 3 cm in August over seasonal ice and from 34 to 4 cm over multiyear ice. Mean rates of snow ablation (including evaporation) in mid‐June were as high as 2 cm/day, comparable to field records from other years. Increases in freeboard after mid‐August in the high latitude (&amp;gt;80&amp;deg;N) multiyear ice cover, north of the Greenland coast, are likely due to earlier freeze‐up and snow accumulation in these regions with shorter melt seasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract Surface height and total freeboard from the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite‐2 (ICESat‐2, IS‐2) sea ice data products (ATL07/ATL10) are assessed with near‐coincident retrievals from the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) lidar in four dedicated underflights during the 2019 Operation IceBridge Arctic deployment. Over a mix of seasonal and older ice, we find remarkable correlations between the ATM and IS‐2 height profiles and roughness (in ninety‐nine 10‐km segments) that averages to &amp;gt;0.95 and &amp;gt; 0.97, respectively. Regression slopes near unity, between 0.93 and 0.99, indicate close agreement of the height estimates. Larger differences between the surface heights are seen in rougher areas where it is more difficult for the photon heights (used in IS‐2 surface finding) to capture the surface distributions at short length scales. Total freeboard in 10‐km segments, calculated using three different approaches, show variability of 0.02 to 0.04 m. Sources of residual variance, attributable to differences between the two instruments, are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

Geophysical Research Letters, 47, e2020GL087629. doi: 10.1029/2020GL087629.&lt;br /&gt;Abstract&lt;br /&gt;The coupled interaction of ocean surface waves and sea ice is important in determining the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of sea ice and its relationship to the ocean and atmosphere. Wave‐ice interactions create the marginal ice zone (MIZ), a region critically important for ecology, transportation, and the polar energy budget. Typically, the MIZ is defined using satellite products as those regions where sea ice concentration is between 15% and 80%. Here we present a new technique to observe ocean surface waves in sea ice, leveraging NASA&#39;s ICESat‐2 satellite laser altimeter, and produce maps of wave‐affected sea ice regions in both hemispheres. Defining a new wave‐based metric for MIZ extent, we find that compared to a concentration‐based metric, wave‐based MIZ estimates are smaller. Further, the wave‐affected MIZ makes up a larger fraction of sea ice extent in winter than in summer, opposite to the seasonal cycle of concentration‐based MIZ.&lt;/p&gt;" data-action-deadline="" data-action-completed="" data-action-contacts="[]">

The soleinstrument onboard, the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System, is nowproviding routine, very high‐resolution, surface elevation data across theglobe, including the Arctic and Southern oceans. In this study, we demonstrateour new processing chain for converting the along‐track ICESat‐2 sea ice freeboard product (ATL10) into sea ice thickness,focusing our initial efforts on the Arctic Ocean. For this conversion, weprimarily make use of snow depth and density data from the NASA Eulerian Snowon Sea Ice Model. The coarse resolution (~100 km) snow data areredistributed onto the high‐resolution (approximately 30–100 m) ATL10freeboards using relationships obtained from snow depth and freeboard datacollected by NASA's Operation IceBridge mission. We present regional sea icethickness distributions and highlight their seasonal evolution through ourfirst winter season of data collection. We include ice thickness uncertaintyestimates, while also acknowledging the limitations of these estimates.

<p>Abstract. In Release 1 and 2 of the ICESat-2 sea ice products, candidate height segments used to estimate the reference sea surface height for freeboard calculations included two surface types: specular and smooth dark leads. We found that the uncorrected photon rates, used as proxies of surface reflectance, are attenuated due to clouds resulting in the potential misclassification of sea ice as dark leads, biasing the reference sea surface height relative to those derived from the more reliable specular returns. This results in higher reference sea surface heights and lowering estimated ice freeboards. Resolution of available cloud flags from the ICESat-2 atmosphere data product are too coarse to provide useful filtering at the lead segment scale. In Release 3, we have modified the surface reference finding algorithm so that only specular leads are used. The consequence of this change can be seen in the freeboard composites of the Arctic and Southern Ocean. Broadly, coverages have decreased by ~10–20 % because there are fewer leads (by excluding the dark leads), and the composite means have increased by 0–4 cm because of the use of more consistent specular leads.</p>

<p>Abstract From the onset of melt in early June, corresponding declines in Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite‐2 (ICESat‐2) freeboard and surface albedo can be seen over the entire Arctic sea ice cover. In the 2019 summer, area‐averaged freeboard decreased from 34 cm prior to melt to a minimum of 12 cm in August while the area‐averaged albedo decreased from ~0.7 to 0.38 for the same period. Calculations using ICESat‐2 freeboards and modeled ice thickness from Pan‐Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) give area‐averaged snow depths ranging from 17 cm prior to melt to 3 cm in August over seasonal ice and from 34 to 4 cm over multiyear ice. Mean rates of snow ablation (including evaporation) in mid‐June were as high as 2 cm/day, comparable to field records from other years. Increases in freeboard after mid‐August in the high latitude (&gt;80°N) multiyear ice cover, north of the Greenland coast, are likely due to earlier freeze‐up and snow accumulation in these regions with shorter melt seasons.</p>

<p>Abstract Surface height and total freeboard from the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite‐2 (ICESat‐2, IS‐2) sea ice data products (ATL07/ATL10) are assessed with near‐coincident retrievals from the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) lidar in four dedicated underflights during the 2019 Operation IceBridge Arctic deployment. Over a mix of seasonal and older ice, we find remarkable correlations between the ATM and IS‐2 height profiles and roughness (in ninety‐nine 10‐km segments) that averages to &gt;0.95 and &gt; 0.97, respectively. Regression slopes near unity, between 0.93 and 0.99, indicate close agreement of the height estimates. Larger differences between the surface heights are seen in rougher areas where it is more difficult for the photon heights (used in IS‐2 surface finding) to capture the surface distributions at short length scales. Total freeboard in 10‐km segments, calculated using three different approaches, show variability of 0.02 to 0.04 m. Sources of residual variance, attributable to differences between the two instruments, are discussed.</p>

Geophysical Research Letters, 47, e2020GL087629. doi: 10.1029/2020GL087629.<br>Abstract<br>The coupled interaction of ocean surface waves and sea ice is important in determining the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of sea ice and its relationship to the ocean and atmosphere. Wave‐ice interactions create the marginal ice zone (MIZ), a region critically important for ecology, transportation, and the polar energy budget. Typically, the MIZ is defined using satellite products as those regions where sea ice concentration is between 15% and 80%. Here we present a new technique to observe ocean surface waves in sea ice, leveraging NASA's ICESat‐2 satellite laser altimeter, and produce maps of wave‐affected sea ice regions in both hemispheres. Defining a new wave‐based metric for MIZ extent, we find that compared to a concentration‐based metric, wave‐based MIZ estimates are smaller. Further, the wave‐affected MIZ makes up a larger fraction of sea ice extent in winter than in summer, opposite to the seasonal cycle of concentration‐based MIZ.</p><p></p>

&lt;p&gt;Kwok, R. (2018), Arctic sea ice thickness, volume, and multiyear ice coverage: Losses and coupled variability (1958 &amp;ndash; 2018). Environ. Res. Lett. 13 (2018) 105005, doi:10.1088/1748-9326/aae3ec. Abstract: Large-scale changes in Arctic sea ice thickness, volume and multiyear sea ice (MYI) coverage with available measurements from submarine sonars, satellite altimeters (&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-125&quot;&gt;ICESat&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;and CryoSat-2), and satellite scatterometers are summarized. The submarine record spans the period between 1958 and 2000, the satellite altimeter records between 2003 and 2018, and the scatterometer records between 1999 and 2017. Regional changes in ice thickness (since 1958) and within the data release area of the Arctic Ocean, previously reported by Kwok and Rothrock (2009 Geophys. Res. Lett. 36 L15501), have been updated to include the 8 years of CryoSat-2 (CS-2) retrievals. Between the pre-1990 submarine period (1958&amp;ndash;1976) and the CS-2 period (2011&amp;ndash;2018) the average thickness near the end of the melt season, in six regions, decreased by 2.0mor some 66% over six decades. Within the data release area (~38% of the Arctic Ocean) of submarine ice draft, the thinning of ~1.75min winter since 1980 (maximum thickness of 3.64min the regression analysis) has not changed significantly; the mean thickness over the CS-2 period is&amp;sim;2m. The 15 year satellite record depicts losses in sea ice volume at 2870km3/decade and 5130km3/decade in winter (February&amp;ndash;March) and fall (October&amp;ndash;November), respectively: more moderate trends compared to the sharp decreases over the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-125&quot;&gt;ICESat&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;period, where the losses were weighted by record-setting melt in 2007. Over the scatterometer record (1999&amp;ndash;2017), the Arctic has lost more than 2&amp;Aring;~106km2 of MYI&amp;mdash;a decrease of more than 50%; MYI now covers less than one-third of the Arctic Ocean. Independent MYI coverage and volume records co-vary in time, the MYI area anomalies explain&amp;sim;85% of the variance in the anomalies in Arctic sea ice volume. If losses of MYI continue, Arctic thickness/volume will be controlled by seasonal ice, suggesting that the thickness/volume trends will be more moderate (as seen here) but more sensitive to climate forcing.&lt;/p&gt;

ATLAS&amp;rsquo;s six beams collect elevation measurements along repeated ground tracks across the Arctic as well as Antarctica, to reveal changes in ice elevation and measurements of sea ice freeboard. Data collection began on Oct. 14, 2018, and the data products have matured to the point that we are able to share them. The initial data is repeatable to better than 13 centimeters for individual measurements, but when heights are averaged over 1 km, that number drops to 2 to 3 cm. The geolocation of these data are accurate to approximately 10 meters, frequently even less.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-125&quot; data-hasqtip=&quot;1&quot;&gt;ICESat&lt;/abbr&gt;-2 collects data globally, taking height measurements of clouds, the ocean, vegetation, land cover and bodies of water. In some coastal areas, with clear waters the satellite can detect the seafloor up to 30 m below the surface.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Arctic poses unique challenges to safe maritime operations, including hazards associated with extreme weather and sea ice. Improving situational awareness is a critical element in supporting planning and emergency response. This research explores the opportunities and challenges associated with leveraging arctic system science research to coproduce sea ice decision support tools. The research is based on information derived from a coastal radar operated as part of university research in Utqiaġvik, Alaska as well as interviews with marine operators and responders, subsistence users, and service providers. A sea ice notification framework is presented, which illustrates how near-real time observations can be integrated into existing trusted notification systems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(2018), Arctic sea ice thickness, volume, and multiyear ice coverage: Losses and coupled variability (1958 &ndash; 2018). Environ. Res. Lett. 13 (2018) 105005, doi:10.1088/1748-9326/aae3ec. Abstract: Large-scale changes in Arctic sea ice thickness, volume and multiyear sea ice (MYI) coverage with available measurements from submarine sonars, satellite altimeters (<abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-125\">ICESat</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>and CryoSat-2), and satellite scatterometers are summarized. The submarine record spans the period between 1958 and 2000, the satellite altimeter records between 2003 and 2018, and the scatterometer records between 1999 and 2017. Regional changes in ice thickness (since 1958) and within the data release area of the Arctic Ocean, previously reported by Kwok and Rothrock (2009 Geophys. Res. Lett. 36 L15501), have been updated to include the 8 years of CryoSat-2 (CS-2) retrievals. Between the pre-1990 submarine period (1958&ndash;1976) and the CS-2 period (2011&ndash;2018) the average thickness near the end of the melt season, in six regions, decreased by 2.0mor some 66% over six decades. Within the data release area (~38% of the Arctic Ocean) of submarine ice draft, the thinning of ~1.75min winter since 1980 (maximum thickness of 3.64min the regression analysis) has not changed significantly; the mean thickness over the CS-2 period is&sim;2m. The 15 year satellite record depicts losses in sea ice volume at 2870km3/decade and 5130km3/decade in winter (February&ndash;March) and fall (October&ndash;November), respectively: more moderate trends compared to the sharp decreases over the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-125\">ICESat</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>period, where the losses were weighted by record-setting melt in 2007. Over the scatterometer record (1999&ndash;2017), the Arctic has lost more than 2&Aring;~106km2 of MYI&mdash;a decrease of more than 50%; MYI now covers less than one-third of the Arctic Ocean. Independent MYI coverage and volume records co-vary in time, the MYI area anomalies explain&sim;85% of the variance in the anomalies in Arctic sea ice volume. If losses of MYI continue, Arctic thickness/volume will be controlled by seasonal ice, suggesting that the thickness/volume trends will be more moderate (as seen here) but more sensitive to climate forcing.</p>\r\n<p><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\">NASA</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>scientist Ron Kwok contributed to this performance element through the following project focus:<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\">NASA</abbr>&rsquo;s Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (<abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-125\">ICESat</abbr>-2) was launched in September of 2018. For sea ice, the lidar instrument onboard<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-125\">ICESat</abbr>-2 is tasked to measure surface height and freeboard&ndash; the vertical height of the floating snow and ice above the sea surface &ndash; which will be used to estimate the thickness the Arctic and Southern Ocean ice covers. One of the first steps in the scientific use of data collected by any new satellite mission is an evaluation of data quality from the instrument. In a paper I submitted, the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-125\">ICESat</abbr>-2 sea ice data is compared with airborne measurements from Operation IceBridge taken in April of 2019. Operation IceBridge is a<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\">NASA</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>airborne mission that has collected data over sea ice since 2009, and served as a bridge between the first<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-125\">ICESat</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>and the new<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-125\">ICESat</abbr>-2. For validation of the sea ice data, the airborne platform was tasked to fly the same satellite ground tracks. In the comparisons, we find the quality of the satellite surface height and freeboards to be high: the airborne and satellite data are in agreement with each other. These results will serve as a baseline for evaluation, improvements of later releases of the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-125\">ICESat</abbr>-2 data set, and for science investigations. A paper is in review as follows: Kwok, R., S. Kacimi, T. Markus, N. T. Kurtz, M. Studinger, J. G. Sonntag, S. S. Manizade, L. N. Boisvert, and J. P.

ATLAS&rsquo;s six beams collect elevation measurements along repeated ground tracks across the Arctic as well as Antarctica, to reveal changes in ice elevation and measurements of sea ice freeboard. Data collection began on Oct. 14, 2018, and the data products have matured to the point that we are able to share them. The initial data is repeatable to better than 13 centimeters for individual measurements, but when heights are averaged over 1 km, that number drops to 2 to 3 cm. The geolocation of these data are accurate to approximately 10 meters, frequently even less.<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-125\" data-hasqtip=\"1\">ICESat</abbr>-2 collects data globally, taking height measurements of clouds, the ocean, vegetation, land cover and bodies of water. In some coastal areas, with clear waters the satellite can detect the seafloor up to 30 m below the surface. Over forests, the satellite can not only detect the top of the canopy, but the forest floor below. We would like to thank the hundreds of people who supported the development and implementation of<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-125\">ICESat</abbr>-2, and have made this data release possible.

Journalof Geophysical Research: Oceans, 125(5), e2019JC015764.AbstractNational Aeronauticsand Space Administration's (NASA's) Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite‐2 (ICESat‐2) mission was launched in September 2018 with the primary goal of monitoring our rapidly changing polar regions. The soleinstrument onboard, the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System, is nowproviding routine, very high‐resolution, surface elevation data across theglobe, including the Arctic and Southern oceans. In this study, we demonstrateour new processing chain for converting the along‐track ICESat‐2 sea ice freeboard product (ATL10) into sea ice thickness,focusing our initial efforts on the Arctic Ocean. For this conversion, weprimarily make use of snow depth and density data from the NASA Eulerian Snowon Sea Ice Model. The coarse resolution (~100 km) snow data areredistributed onto the high‐resolution (approximately 30&ndash;100 m) ATL10freeboards using relationships obtained from snow depth and freeboard datacollected by NASA's Operation IceBridge mission. We present regional sea icethickness distributions and highlight their seasonal evolution through ourfirst winter season of data collection. We include ice thickness uncertaintyestimates, while also acknowledging the limitations of these estimates. Wegenerate a gridded monthly thickness product and compare this with variousmonthly sea ice thickness estimates obtained from European Space Agency'sCryoSat‐2 satellite mission, with ICESat‐2 showing consistentlylower thicknesses. Finally, we compare our February/March 2019 thicknessestimates to ICESat February/March (19 February to 21 March) 2008 ice thicknessestimates using the same input assumptions, which show an ~0.37 m or ~20%thinning across an inner Arctic Ocean domain in this 11‐year time period.

Journal of Geophysical Research:Oceans, 125(3), e2019JC016008.AbstractWe present a firstexamination of Arctic sea ice snow depth estimates from differencing satellitelidar (ICESat‐2) and radar (CryoSat‐2) freeboards. These estimates cover theperiod between 14 October 2018 and the end of April 2019. Snow depth is relatedto freeboard differences by the refractive index/bulk density of the snowlayer&mdash;the only free parameter in the approach. Area‐averaged snow depth ranges from 9 cm (on first‐year ice: 5 cm, multiyear ice: 14 cm) in late Octoberto 19 cm (first‐year ice: 17 cm, multiyear ice: 27 cm)in April; on average, this snow is thinner over FYI. Spatial patterns andgradients of snow depth estimates compare well with reconstructions usingsnowfall from ERA‐Interim and ERA5, although snowfall from ERA5is systematically higher. For all months, the results suggest that ~50% of thetotal freeboard is comprised of snow. Retrievals are within a few centimetersof snow depth data acquired by Operation IceBridge in April 2019. Sources ofuncertainties associated with this freeboard‐differencing approachare discussed. Further, sea ice thicknesses calculated using the retrieved snowdepth and a modified climatology are contrasted. Comparatively, the snow depthand calculated ice thickness using a modified climatology are higher by~5 cm and 0.33 m, although these differences are not uniformthroughout the season. Snow accumulation was slower between October andDecember but increased between December and January, unlike the modified climatology,which exhibited a monotonic accumulation for all months. Future opportunitiesfor assessment and improvement of these estimates are discussed. Performanceelement 5.1.1: NASA has continued support of ice elevation measurements fromICESat-2 through the release of the ATL06 land ice height product at NSIDC https://nsidc.org/data/atl06.Details of the land ice height retrieval algorithm are published in Smith etal., 2019 with evaluation and validation of the product published in Brunt etal., 2019.

Remote Sensing of Environment, 233,111352. https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/286728905.pdfAbstractThe Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2)and its sole scientific instrument, the Advanced Topographic Laser AltimeterSystem (ATLAS), was launched on 15 September 2018 with a primary goal ofmeasuring changes in the surface of the Earth's land ice (glaciers and icesheets). ATLAS is a photon-counting laser altimeter, which records the transittime of individual photons in order to reconstruct surface height along track.The ground-track pattern repeats every 91 days such that changes in ice sheetsurface height can be estimated through time. In this paper, we describe theset of algorithms that have been developed for ICESat-2 to retrieve ice sheetsurface height from the geolocated photons for the Land Ice Along-Track HeightProduct (ATL06), and demonstrate their output and performance using a syntheticdataset over various land-ice surfaces and under different cloud conditions. Weshow that the ATL06 algorithm is expected to perform at the level required tomeet the ICESat-2 science objectives for land ice. Brunt,K. M., Neumann, T. A., &amp; Smith, B. E. (2019).

Geophysical Research Letters, 46(22),13072-13078. https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GL084886AbstractWe collected kinematic Global Navigation Satellite Systems(GNSS) surface height data, on a 750‐km ground‐basedtraverse of the flat interior of the Antarctic ice sheet, for comparison withIce, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite‐2 (ICESat‐2)surface heights. Vertical errors in the GNSS data are estimated to be 5.6 cm,comparable to results from a previous traverse and with year‐to‐yearcomparisons. Comparisons of the GNSS heights and 6 months of ICESat‐2ATL03 photon‐based heights and ATL06 segment‐based heights indicatethat the accuracy and precision of ICESat‐2 data are comparable tothat of results from the ICESat mission: ATL03 is currently accurate to betterthan 5 cm with better than 13 cm of surface measurement precision, while ATL06is currently accurate to better than 3 cm with better than 9 cm of surfacemeasurement precision.

Science, 368(6496), pp.1239-1242. https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6496/1239?rss=1AbstractQuantifying changes in Earth&rsquo;s ice sheets and identifying the climatedrivers are central to improving sea level projections. We provide unifiedestimates of grounded and floating ice mass change from 2003 to 2019 usingNASA&rsquo;s Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) and ICESat-2 satellitelaser altimetry. Our data reveal patterns likely linked to competing climateprocesses: Ice loss from coastal Greenland (increased surface melt), Antarcticice shelves (increased ocean melting), and Greenland and Antarctic outletglaciers (dynamic response to ocean melting) was partially compensated by massgains over ice sheet interiors (increased snow accumulation). Losses outpacedgains, with grounded-ice loss from Greenland (200 billion tonnes per year) andAntarctica (118 billion tonnes per year) contributing 14 millimeters to sealevel. Mass lost from West Antarctica&rsquo;s ice shelves accounted for more than 30%of that region&rsquo;s total.</p>\r\n<p>Ron Kwok provided:</p>\r\n<p>Refining the sea surface identification approach for determining freeboards in the ICESat-2 sea ice products <br />Ron Kwok, Alek A. Petty, Marco Bagnardi, Nathan T. Kurtz, Glenn F. Cunningham, and Alvaro Ivanoff</p>\r\n<p>Abstract. In Release 1 and 2 of the ICESat-2 sea ice products, candidate height segments used to estimate the reference sea surface height for freeboard calculations included two surface types: specular and smooth dark leads. We found that the uncorrected photon rates, used as proxies of surface reflectance, are attenuated due to clouds resulting in the potential misclassification of sea ice as dark leads, biasing the reference sea surface height relative to those derived from the more reliable specular returns. This results in higher reference sea surface heights and lowering estimated ice freeboards. Resolution of available cloud flags from the ICESat-2 atmosphere data product are too coarse to provide useful filtering at the lead segment scale. In Release 3, we have modified the surface reference finding algorithm so that only specular leads are used. The consequence of this change can be seen in the freeboard composites of the Arctic and Southern Ocean. Broadly, coverages have decreased by ~10&ndash;20&thinsp;% because there are fewer leads (by excluding the dark leads), and the composite means have increased by 0&ndash;4&thinsp;cm because of the use of more consistent specular leads.</p>\r\n<p>Kwok, R., Petty, A.

A.Webster, N. T.Kurtz, and A. A. Petty</p>\r\n<p>Abstract From the onset of melt in early June, corresponding declines in Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite‐2 (ICESat‐2) freeboard and surface albedo can be seen over the entire Arctic sea ice cover. In the 2019 summer, area‐averaged freeboard decreased from 34 cm prior to melt to a minimum of 12 cm in August while the area‐averaged albedo decreased from ~0.7 to 0.38 for the same period. Calculations using ICESat‐2 freeboards and modeled ice thickness from Pan‐Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) give area‐averaged snow depths ranging from 17 cm prior to melt to 3 cm in August over seasonal ice and from 34 to 4 cm over multiyear ice. Mean rates of snow ablation (including evaporation) in mid‐June were as high as 2 cm/day, comparable to field records from other years. Increases in freeboard after mid‐August in the high latitude (&gt;80&deg;N) multiyear ice cover, north of the Greenland coast, are likely due to earlier freeze‐up and snow accumulation in these regions with shorter melt seasons.</p>\r\n<p>Kwok, R., Cunningham, G.

Over a mix of seasonal and older ice, we find remarkable correlations between the ATM and IS‐2 height profiles and roughness (in ninety‐nine 10‐km segments) that averages to &gt;0.95 and &gt; 0.97, respectively. Regression slopes near unity, between 0.93 and 0.99, indicate close agreement of the height estimates. Larger differences between the surface heights are seen in rougher areas where it is more difficult for the photon heights (used in IS‐2 surface finding) to capture the surface distributions at short length scales. Total freeboard in 10‐km segments, calculated using three different approaches, show variability of 0.02 to 0.04 m.

Geophysical Research Letters, 47, e2020GL087629. doi: 10.1029/2020GL087629.<br />Abstract<br />The coupled interaction of ocean surface waves and sea ice is important in determining the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of sea ice and its relationship to the ocean and atmosphere. Wave‐ice interactions create the marginal ice zone (MIZ), a region critically important for ecology, transportation, and the polar energy budget. Typically, the MIZ is defined using satellite products as those regions where sea ice concentration is between 15% and 80%. Here we present a new technique to observe ocean surface waves in sea ice, leveraging NASA's ICESat‐2 satellite laser altimeter, and produce maps of wave‐affected sea ice regions in both hemispheres. Defining a new wave‐based metric for MIZ extent, we find that compared to a concentration‐based metric, wave‐based MIZ estimates are smaller. Further, the wave‐affected MIZ makes up a larger fraction of sea ice extent in winter than in summer, opposite to the seasonal cycle of concentration‐based MIZ.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"","completed":"","followupvalue":"","id":2506,"users":[],"followup":null}];

The new version of ice age estimates indicates more older ice than Version 3, especially earlier in the record, but similar trends toward less multiyear ice. Changes in sea ice motion and age derived from the product show a significant shift in the Arctic ice cover, from a pack with a high concentration of older ice to a sea ice cover dominated by first-year ice, which is more susceptible to summer melt.

&lt;p&gt;Nereida Rodriguez-Alvarez, Benjamin Holt, Sermsak Jaruwatanadilok, Erika Podest, Katherine C. Cavanaugh (Sept 2019) &amp;ldquo;An Arctic sea ice multi-step classification based on GNSS-R data from the TDS-1 mission.&amp;rdquo; Remote Sensing of Environment, 230 (1). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.05.021Abstract: This study examines the potential of using bistatic radar reflections from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) to classify sea ice types in the Arctic Ocean during the sea ice formation period. For this study, we used data obtained from the United Kingdom (UK) TechDemoSat-1 (TDS-1) satellite mission. The main objective of the TDS-1 mission is to provide L-band radar reflections of the ocean surface in order to infer wind speed through an estimation of the ocean surface roughness. Given the orbit inclination of TDS-1, polar coverage is obtained providing datasets over the Arctic sea ice cover. Recent studies demonstrated the use of TDS-1 data for accurately deriving ocean-ice detection using the shape of the bistatic radar waveforms derived from delay-Doppler maps. We aim to advance this previous research by demonstrating the sensitivity of GNSS bistatic radar signals to sea ice types. The originality of the study presented in this manuscript is the classification of sea ice types, never implemented before with any GNSS-R mission. For this study, we examined the fall period of October 2015 in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas region, when considerable expanses of young ice, first-year ice (FYI), and multi-year ice (MYI) were present. We developed a sea ice multi-step classification approach based on bistatic radar reflections to generate not only an ocean-ice classification but to classify between the three dominant ice types present. The classification was done in multiple steps based on GNSS bistatic radar observations only and includes checks for spatio-temporal consistency with each dominant class. Validation results are based on the comparison of the GNSS classification against&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-203&quot;&gt;SAR&lt;/abbr&gt;-derived sea ice type maps produced at the US National Ice Center. First, we derived classifications of sea ice&amp;ndash;open water samples with a success rate of 97%, comparable to previous studies. Next, the sea ice type classification results identified FYI, MYI and young ice with success rates of 70%, 82% and 81%, respectively, indicating a strong sensitivity of the L-band GNSS bistatic radar signals to the different surface scattering properties of these primary ice types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this manuscript we demonstrate the potential of the GNSS bistatic radar signals to classify ice types during the sea ice formation period. GNSS bistatic radar signals provide unique forward scattered measurements at L-band, potentially on a daily temporal revisit, that can be used to produce enhanced information on sea ice characteristics, such as those currently generated by other sensors. In order to determine the use of GNSS-R measurements on an operational basis, further studies are needed over a year-long period of sea ice growth and melt to determine the full benefit of GNSS for improving and providing complementary information to that generated by both microwave and optical sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Nereida Rodriguez-Alvarez, Benjamin Holt, Sermsak Jaruwatanadilok, Erika Podest, Katherine C. Cavanaugh (Sept 2019) “An Arctic sea ice multi-step classification based on GNSS-R data from the TDS-1 mission.” Remote Sensing of Environment, 230 (1). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.05.021Abstract: This study examines the potential of using bistatic radar reflections from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) to classify sea ice types in the Arctic Ocean during the sea ice formation period. For this study, we used data obtained from the United Kingdom (UK) TechDemoSat-1 (TDS-1) satellite mission. The main objective of the TDS-1 mission is to provide L-band radar reflections of the ocean surface in order to infer wind speed through an estimation of the ocean surface roughness. Given the orbit inclination of TDS-1, polar coverage is obtained providing datasets over the Arctic sea ice cover. Recent studies demonstrated the use of TDS-1 data for accurately deriving ocean-ice detection using the shape of the bistatic radar waveforms derived from delay-Doppler maps. We aim to advance this previous research by demonstrating the sensitivity of GNSS bistatic radar signals to sea ice types. The originality of the study presented in this manuscript is the classification of sea ice types, never implemented before with any GNSS-R mission. For this study, we examined the fall period of October 2015 in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas region, when considerable expanses of young ice, first-year ice (FYI), and multi-year ice (MYI) were present. We developed a sea ice multi-step classification approach based on bistatic radar reflections to generate not only an ocean-ice classification but to classify between the three dominant ice types present. The classification was done in multiple steps based on GNSS bistatic radar observations only and includes checks for spatio-temporal consistency with each dominant class. Validation results are based on the comparison of the GNSS classification against<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-203">SAR</abbr>-derived sea ice type maps produced at the US National Ice Center. First, we derived classifications of sea ice–open water samples with a success rate of 97%, comparable to previous studies. Next, the sea ice type classification results identified FYI, MYI and young ice with success rates of 70%, 82% and 81%, respectively, indicating a strong sensitivity of the L-band GNSS bistatic radar signals to the different surface scattering properties of these primary ice types.</p>
<p>With this manuscript we demonstrate the potential of the GNSS bistatic radar signals to classify ice types during the sea ice formation period. GNSS bistatic radar signals provide unique forward scattered measurements at L-band, potentially on a daily temporal revisit, that can be used to produce enhanced information on sea ice characteristics, such as those currently generated by other sensors.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;-funded Principal Investigator Chris Polashenski at Dartmouth is conducting research to process all Operation IceBridge DMS imagery for melt pond fractions. A summary of the research to date follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melt ponds increase absorption of sunlight by sea ice and enhance sea ice melt. Their coverage is widely understood to be a critical control over sea ice albedo feedbacks. But melt ponds are not routinely observed by remote sensing, partly because they occur below the pixel size of most global-coverage satellite imagery. New remote sensing techniques are needed to produce an observational record of seasonal and inter-annual changes in melt pond coverage from higher resolution imagery. We seek to address this gap by employing machine learning techniques to classify melt ponds in images of sea ice. The short term goal of this project is to process the IceBridge DMS imagery to create a publically available melt pond data product that can be used to support research on ice-albedo feedbacks. The longer term goal is to create an operational workflow for processing other high resolution datastreams (e.g. Digital Globe, Pleiades, Planet) and hosting the data as a standardized sea ice product comparable to sea ice concentration, extent, and thickness data from other sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with processing imagery at an operational scale, we are confronting the challenges of creating a record having the quality, reproducibility, and traceability required to assess change over time. Several investigators have proposed possible approaches for processing high resolution sea ice imagery &amp;ndash; among those possible methods is our Open Source Sea ice imagery Processing Algorithm (OSSP) [Wright and Polashenski, 2018]. In this project, we are working to take the OSSP to the next level, addressing documentation and standardization issues needed to ensure the output created is a reproducible, traceable, research grade product suitable for assessing long term trends. Processed DMS imagery and documentation should be available and posted to&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-178&quot;&gt;NSIDC&lt;/abbr&gt;-IceBridge data archives in late 2018.[see attached image: Result of processing an Operation IceBridge DMS image using the OSSP algorithm]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;has funded an ice motion and ice age project with a Principal Investigator at University of Colorado. A summary of this project follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have developed a Lagrangian ice tracking database, based on an algorithm developed in-house which utilizes the sea ice motion algorithm to track individual &amp;ldquo;parcels&amp;rdquo; of Arctic sea ice, as they advect through the Arctic Ocean. The tracking is performed on the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-178&quot;&gt;NSIDC&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;25-km EASE-grid, to accommodate coupling the positions of parcels with surface and atmospheric properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;We examined the influence of ice surface temperature, ice thickness, surface albedo, downwelling longwave/shortwave radiation, and snow depth on the change in ice concentration in the Beaufort Sea from 2009 to 2016. Results from this analysis indicated that parcels that melt during summer in the Beaufort Sea reside at lower latitudes and had lower ice thickness at the beginning of the melt season in most cases.&lt;/p&gt;

<p><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-155">NASA</abbr>-funded Principal Investigator Chris Polashenski at Dartmouth is conducting research to process all Operation IceBridge DMS imagery for melt pond fractions. A summary of the research to date follows:</p>
<p>Melt ponds increase absorption of sunlight by sea ice and enhance sea ice melt. Their coverage is widely understood to be a critical control over sea ice albedo feedbacks. But melt ponds are not routinely observed by remote sensing, partly because they occur below the pixel size of most global-coverage satellite imagery. New remote sensing techniques are needed to produce an observational record of seasonal and inter-annual changes in melt pond coverage from higher resolution imagery. We seek to address this gap by employing machine learning techniques to classify melt ponds in images of sea ice. The short term goal of this project is to process the IceBridge DMS imagery to create a publically available melt pond data product that can be used to support research on ice-albedo feedbacks. The longer term goal is to create an operational workflow for processing other high resolution datastreams (e.g. Digital Globe, Pleiades, Planet) and hosting the data as a standardized sea ice product comparable to sea ice concentration, extent, and thickness data from other sources.</p>
<p>Along with processing imagery at an operational scale, we are confronting the challenges of creating a record having the quality, reproducibility, and traceability required to assess change over time. Several investigators have proposed possible approaches for processing high resolution sea ice imagery – among those possible methods is our Open Source Sea ice imagery Processing Algorithm (OSSP) [Wright and Polashenski, 2018]. In this project, we are working to take the OSSP to the next level, addressing documentation and standardization issues needed to ensure the output created is a reproducible, traceable, research grade product suitable for assessing long term trends. Processed DMS imagery and documentation should be available and posted to<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-178">NSIDC</abbr>-IceBridge data archives in late 2018.[see attached image: Result of processing an Operation IceBridge DMS image using the OSSP algorithm]</p>
<p><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-155">NASA</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>has funded an ice motion and ice age project with a Principal Investigator at University of Colorado. A summary of this project follows:</p>
<p>We have developed a Lagrangian ice tracking database, based on an algorithm developed in-house which utilizes the sea ice motion algorithm to track individual “parcels” of Arctic sea ice, as they advect through the Arctic Ocean. The tracking is performed on the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-178">NSIDC</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>25-km EASE-grid, to accommodate coupling the positions of parcels with surface and atmospheric properties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We examined the influence of ice surface temperature, ice thickness, surface albedo, downwelling longwave/shortwave radiation, and snow depth on the change in ice concentration in the Beaufort Sea from 2009 to 2016. Results from this analysis indicated that parcels that melt during summer in the Beaufort Sea reside at lower latitudes and had lower ice thickness at the beginning of the melt season in most cases.</p>

&lt;p&gt;The ocean and atmosphere exert stresses on sea ice that create elongated cracks or openings (leads) where the ocean is exposed directly to the atmosphere. Leads cover a small fraction of the surface but dominate the vertical exchange of energy, particularly in winter when turbulent heat&amp;nbsp; fluxes over leads can be orders of magnitude larger than over thick ice. The width of leads and their orientation relative to atmospheric flow markedly influence associated vertical fluxes relevant to cloud formation with recent studies suggesting that these fluxes can influence the atmospheric properties tens to hundreds of kilometers downstream.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Arctic sea ice is changing rapidly, and observational and modeling results suggest an increasing influence of lead-induced feedbacks on the climate system. For instance&amp;nbsp; Positive feedbacks can result if leads act to increase cloud cover which then warms the surface, leading to more or persistent open water.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If convective plumes cause entrainment of drier free tropospheric air that decreases cloud cover, surface cooling and a negative feedback would result.&amp;nbsp; Because leads are a crucially important driver of the Arctic surface energy budget, their increasing prominence makes the need for quantifying and understanding their impact on the Arctic climate system especially pressing at this time. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

A summary of the research to date follows:</p>\r\n<p>Melt ponds increase absorption of sunlight by sea ice and enhance sea ice melt. Their coverage is widely understood to be a critical control over sea ice albedo feedbacks. But melt ponds are not routinely observed by remote sensing, partly because they occur below the pixel size of most global-coverage satellite imagery. New remote sensing techniques are needed to produce an observational record of seasonal and inter-annual changes in melt pond coverage from higher resolution imagery. We seek to address this gap by employing machine learning techniques to classify melt ponds in images of sea ice. The short term goal of this project is to process the IceBridge DMS imagery to create a publically available melt pond data product that can be used to support research on ice-albedo feedbacks. The longer term goal is to create an operational workflow for processing other high resolution datastreams (e.g. Digital Globe, Pleiades, Planet) and hosting the data as a standardized sea ice product comparable to sea ice concentration, extent, and thickness data from other sources.</p>\r\n<p>Along with processing imagery at an operational scale, we are confronting the challenges of creating a record having the quality, reproducibility, and traceability required to assess change over time. Several investigators have proposed possible approaches for processing high resolution sea ice imagery &ndash; among those possible methods is our Open Source Sea ice imagery Processing Algorithm (OSSP) [Wright and Polashenski, 2018]. In this project, we are working to take the OSSP to the next level, addressing documentation and standardization issues needed to ensure the output created is a reproducible, traceable, research grade product suitable for assessing long term trends.

Results from this analysis indicated that parcels that melt during summer in the Beaufort Sea reside at lower latitudes and had lower ice thickness at the beginning of the melt season in most cases.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<ul class=\"attachments\">\r\n<li><a href=\"/members/documents/12181\" data-file-type=\"docx\"><span>&nbsp;</span>NASA Operation Icebridge Digital Mapping Sensor Input for PE 3.1.5 with image<span>&nbsp;</span><span class=\"mute\">(DOCX, 306 KB)</span></a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"9/27/2018","completed":"September 27, 2018","followupvalue":"20180927","id":1799,"users":[{"id":279,"name":"Christine Mataya","link":"/members/people/286"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","September 27, 2018"]}},{"milestone":217,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"July 26, 2019","shortdate":"7/26/2019","datevalue":"20190726","action":"<p>The National Science Foundation has recently awarded OPP &ndash; 1838401. &nbsp;As part of the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) campaign, project is deploying a four channel ultra-wideband microwave radiometer observing from 0.5 to 2 GHz as part in order to acquire a unique dataset of ice thermal emissions and their variations with thickness and other ice properties.

Abstract: Large-scale changes in Arctic sea ice thickness, volume and multiyear sea ice (MYI) coverage with available measurements from submarine sonars, satellite altimeters (<abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-125\">ICESat</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>and CryoSat-2), and satellite scatterometers are summarized. The submarine record spans the period between 1958 and 2000, the satellite altimeter records between 2003 and 2018, and the scatterometer records between 1999 and 2017. Regional changes in ice thickness (since 1958) and within the data release area of the Arctic Ocean, previously reported by Kwok and Rothrock (2009 Geophys. Res. Lett. 36 L15501), have been updated to include the 8 years of CryoSat-2 (CS-2) retrievals. Between the pre-1990 submarine period (1958&ndash;1976) and the CS-2 period (2011&ndash;2018) the average thickness near the end of the melt season, in six regions, decreased by 2.0mor some 66% over six decades. Within the data release area (~38% of the Arctic Ocean) of submarine ice draft, the thinning of ~1.75min winter since 1980 (maximum thickness of 3.64min the regression analysis) has not changed significantly; the mean thickness over the CS-2 period is&sim;2m. The 15 year satellite record depicts losses in sea ice volume at 2870km3/decade and 5130km3/decade in winter (February&ndash;March) and fall (October&ndash;November), respectively: more moderate trends compared to the sharp decreases over the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-125\">ICESat</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>period, where the losses were weighted by record-setting melt in 2007. Over the scatterometer record (1999&ndash;2017), the Arctic has lost more than 2&Aring;~106km2 of MYI&mdash;a decrease of more than 50%; MYI now covers less than one-third of the Arctic Ocean. Independent MYI coverage and volume records co-vary in time, the MYI area anomalies explain&sim;85% of the variance in the anomalies in Arctic sea ice volume. If losses of MYI continue, Arctic thickness/volume will be controlled by seasonal ice, suggesting that the thickness/volume trends will be more moderate (as seen here) but more sensitive to climate forcing.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"10/4/2019","completed":"October 4, 2019","followupvalue":"20191004","id":2224,"users":[{"id":279,"name":"Christine Mataya","link":"/members/people/286"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","October 4, 2019"]}},{"milestone":217,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"October 4, 2019","shortdate":"10/4/2019","datevalue":"20191004","action":"<p><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\" data-hasqtip=\"1\">NASA</abbr>-funded Principal Investigator contributed to this performance element as follows:</p>\r\n<p>Nereida Rodriguez-Alvarez, Benjamin Holt, Sermsak Jaruwatanadilok, Erika Podest, Katherine C. Cavanaugh (Sept 2019) &ldquo;An Arctic sea ice multi-step classification based on GNSS-R data from the TDS-1 mission.&rdquo; Remote Sensing of Environment, 230 (1). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.05.021Abstract: This study examines the potential of using bistatic radar reflections from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) to classify sea ice types in the Arctic Ocean during the sea ice formation period. For this study, we used data obtained from the United Kingdom (UK) TechDemoSat-1 (TDS-1) satellite mission. The main objective of the TDS-1 mission is to provide L-band radar reflections of the ocean surface in order to infer wind speed through an estimation of the ocean surface roughness. Given the orbit inclination of TDS-1, polar coverage is obtained providing datasets over the Arctic sea ice cover. Recent studies demonstrated the use of TDS-1 data for accurately deriving ocean-ice detection using the shape of the bistatic radar waveforms derived from delay-Doppler maps. We aim to advance this previous research by demonstrating the sensitivity of GNSS bistatic radar signals to sea ice types. The originality of the study presented in this manuscript is the classification of sea ice types, never implemented before with any GNSS-R mission. For this study, we examined the fall period of October 2015 in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas region, when considerable expanses of young ice, first-year ice (FYI), and multi-year ice (MYI) were present. We developed a sea ice multi-step classification approach based on bistatic radar reflections to generate not only an ocean-ice classification but to classify between the three dominant ice types present. The classification was done in multiple steps based on GNSS bistatic radar observations only and includes checks for spatio-temporal consistency with each dominant class. Validation results are based on the comparison of the GNSS classification against<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-203\">SAR</abbr>-derived sea ice type maps produced at the US National Ice Center. First, we derived classifications of sea ice&ndash;open water samples with a success rate of 97%, comparable to previous studies. Next, the sea ice type classification results identified FYI, MYI and young ice with success rates of 70%, 82% and 81%, respectively, indicating a strong sensitivity of the L-band GNSS bistatic radar signals to the different surface scattering properties of these primary ice types.</p>\r\n<p>With this manuscript we demonstrate the potential of the GNSS bistatic radar signals to classify ice types during the sea ice formation period. GNSS bistatic radar signals provide unique forward scattered measurements at L-band, potentially on a daily temporal revisit, that can be used to produce enhanced information on sea ice characteristics, such as those currently generated by other sensors. In order to determine the use of GNSS-R measurements on an operational basis, further studies are needed over a year-long period of sea ice growth and melt to determine the full benefit of GNSS for improving and providing complementary information to that generated by both microwave and optical sensors.</p>\r\n<p>George Riggs provided:The<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\">NASA</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>Sea Ice Cover products for the Terra and Aqua MODerate resolution Imaging Spectoradiaometer (<abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-150\">MODIS</abbr>) and the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-<abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-287\">NPP</abbr>) Visible Infrared Imaging Suite (<abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-242\">VIIRS</abbr>) sensors, have been used to identify the coverage of Arctic and Antarctic sea ice.

First, we provide a history of these NASA products distributed at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Then we discuss the improvements to the algorithms, provide validation results for the new (Version 4) and older versions, and intercompare the two. While Version 4 algorithm changes were significant, the impact on the products is relatively minor, particularly for more recent years. The changes in Version 4 reduce motion biases by &sim;&thinsp;0.01 to 0.02&thinsp;cm&thinsp;s&minus;1 and error standard deviations by &sim;&thinsp;0.3&thinsp;cm&thinsp;s&minus;1. Overall, ice speed increased in Version 4 over Version 3 by 0.5 to 2.0&thinsp;cm&thinsp;s&minus;1 over most of the time series. Version 4 shows a higher positive trend for the Arctic of 0.21&thinsp;cm&thinsp;s&minus;1 per decade compared to 0.13&thinsp;cm&thinsp;s&minus;1 per decade for Version 3. The new version of ice age estimates indicates more older ice than Version 3, especially earlier in the record, but similar trends toward less multiyear ice. Changes in sea ice motion and age derived from the product show a significant shift in the Arctic ice cover, from a pack with a high concentration of older ice to a sea ice cover dominated by first-year ice, which is more susceptible to summer melt. We also observe an increase in the speed of the ice over the time series &ge;&thinsp;30 years, which has been shown in other studies and is anticipated with the annual decrease in sea ice extent.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Additional PI activity:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>The NASA Sea Ice Cover products for the Terra and Aqua MODerate resolution Imaging Spectoradiaometer (MODIS) and the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Suite (VIIRS) sensors, have been used to identify the coverage of Arctic and Antarctic sea ice.

These impacts mainly depend on the iceberg volume, which remains an elusive parameter to measure. We investigate the capability of TanDEM-X bistatic single-pass synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) to derive iceberg subaerial morphology and infer total volume. We cross-verify InSAR results with Operation IceBridge (OIB) data acquired near Wordie Bay, Antarctica, as part of the OIB/TanDEM-X Antarctic Science Campaign (OTASC). While icebergs are typically classified according to size based on length or maximum height, we develop a new volumetric classification approach for applications where iceberg volume is relevant. For icebergs with heights exceeding 5&amp;thinsp;m, we find iceberg volumes derived from TanDEM-X and OIB data match within 7&amp;thinsp;%. We also derive a range of possible iceberg keel depths relevant to grounding and potential impacts on subsea installations. These results suggest that TanDEM-X could pave the way for future single-pass interferometric systems for scientific and operational iceberg mapping and classification based on iceberg volume and keel depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Arctic poses unique challenges to safe maritime operations, including hazards associated with extreme weather and sea ice. Improving situational awareness is a critical element in supporting planning and emergency response. This research explores the opportunities and challenges associated with leveraging arctic system science research to coproduce sea ice decision support tools. The research is based on information derived from a coastal radar operated as part of university research in Utqiaġvik, Alaska as well as interviews with marine operators and responders, subsistence users, and service providers. A sea ice notification framework is presented, which illustrates how near-real time observations can be integrated into existing trusted notification systems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This meeting explored the newest satellite-based observations being collected from&nbsp;<abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-125">ICESat</abbr>-2 (presented by Sinead Farrell, U Maryland) and a new sea ice notification framework being developed for coastal communities (Nathan Kettle,&nbsp;<abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-117">IARC</abbr>). This meeting is the first in a series of discussions aimed at building stronger connections between the observing, modeling and user communities.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></div>
<div><span>One outcome of the discussion at this meeting was the&nbsp;acknowledgment&nbsp;</span>of the need for&nbsp;more discussion of potential applications of research that could incorporate the co-production of&nbsp;knowledge. Sea ice thickness information would likely be of interest to many communities. Also, there is potential to use ICE-Sat2 data for model forecasts, although the latency period makes the data less useful for immediate decision support.</div>

<p><span>The Arctic poses unique challenges to safe maritime operations, including hazards associated with extreme weather and sea ice. Improving situational awareness is a critical element in supporting planning and emergency response. This research explores the opportunities and challenges associated with leveraging arctic system science research to coproduce sea ice decision support tools. The research is based on information derived from a coastal radar operated as part of university research in Utqiaġvik, Alaska as well as interviews with marine operators and responders, subsistence users, and service providers. A sea ice notification framework is presented, which illustrates how near-real time observations can be integrated into existing trusted notification systems.</span></p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Goals of Meeting: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community round table discussion around the record low ice conditions in the Bering Sea Ice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine how the IARPC Collaboration Teams can act together to facilitate community-wide interaction around major events (e.g., shaping research needs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine future actions based on discussion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outcomes: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compile what we know is happening now in the Bering and what we expect to happen and include local observations in that compilation. (This is centered on observations and modeling. I would add that we also need to do what John was talking about and compile what information/workshops/resources are out there and make them available in one place. Maybe an ARCUS task using in part the ARCUS calendar? Once someone gets a spreadsheet set up, others could add to it.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up a working group to develop a system that duplicates the Bering Sea Executive Order. Joel Clement, Martin and ARCUS expressed interest in working on this.&lt;/li&gt;

These impacts mainly depend on the iceberg volume, which remains an elusive parameter to measure. We investigate the capability of TanDEM-X bistatic single-pass synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) to derive iceberg subaerial morphology and infer total volume. We cross-verify InSAR results with Operation IceBridge (OIB) data acquired near Wordie Bay, Antarctica, as part of the OIB/TanDEM-X Antarctic Science Campaign (OTASC). While icebergs are typically classified according to size based on length or maximum height, we develop a new volumetric classification approach for applications where iceberg volume is relevant. For icebergs with heights exceeding 5&thinsp;m, we find iceberg volumes derived from TanDEM-X and OIB data match within 7&thinsp;%. We also derive a range of possible iceberg keel depths relevant to grounding and potential impacts on subsea installations. These results suggest that TanDEM-X could pave the way for future single-pass interferometric systems for scientific and operational iceberg mapping and classification based on iceberg volume and keel depth.</p>\r\n<p>Regarding the text &ldquo;enable persistent data collection,&rdquo; the paper points to the future LOTUSat-1 (launch delayed to 2023) and LOTUSat-2<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-203\">SAR</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>Mission (launch in 3 to 5 years after LOTUSat-1 for data may be collected as far out beyond 2030) at X-band (same frequency as TanDEM-X used in OTASC), to be launched by the Vietnam National Space Center.

These data will also be used to improve coupled physical-biogeochemical models of the Arctic Ocean.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"8/20/2020","completed":"August 20, 2020","followupvalue":"20200820","id":2450,"users":[{"id":1080,"name":"Kate Ruck","link":"/members/people/4560"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","August 20, 2020"]}},{"milestone":232,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"August 20, 2020","shortdate":"8/20/2020","datevalue":"20200820","action":"<p>The National Science Foundation has recently awarded OPP &ndash; 1951762, 1951767.

This project intends to maintain a network of buoys with a spacing of less than 250 km, or more than 200 buoys spread across the Arctic Ocean. These observations are assimilated into Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models that are used to forecast weather on synoptic time scales, and into the many long-term atmospheric reanalyses that are used for climate studies. Overall, the observations from the IABP are for: 1) monitoring Arctic and global climate change; 2) forcing, assimilation, and validation of global weather and climate models; and 3) validation of satellite derived estimates of sea ice motion, surface temperature, and sea ice thickness.

(2019), Low level and surface wind jets near sea ice edge in the Beaufort Sea in late autumn, J. Geophys. Res., early online publication, doi:10.1029/2018JD029770. Abstract: Low‐level wind jets (LLJs) and strong surface winds are frequently observed near the sea ice edge in the presence of strong thermal contrast between open water and sea ice. Two LLJ cases near the sea ice edge in the Beaufort Sea are examined using dropsonde observations made from Seasonal Ice Zone Reconnaissance Survey flights. Ensembles of Polar Weather Research and Forecast simulations with and without sea ice demonstrate the contribution of the surface thermal contrast to the boundary layer structure, the LLJ, and surface ice edge jets. Because the surface temperature contrast only influences the lower most hundreds of meters in the atmospheric boundary layer, its contribution to the temperature gradient and wind speed at the level of the LLJ is limited. The sea ice does strengthen the LLJ by extending the LLJ northward over sea ice and increasing the maximum LLJ wind speeds by up to 13% and as much as 29% further north at a lower altitude. However, the primary reason for the observed strong winds in these two cases are the synoptic interactions between anticyclones and approaching cyclones. The effect of the surface thermal contrast on surface winds is controlled by a separate mechanism. The cold and stable boundary layer over sea ice prevents the momentum transport from the LLJ to the surface. This leads to weaker surface winds over sea ice and confines the strong surface winds close to the sea ice edge. This mechanism contributes to the frequent occurrence of the surface &amp;ldquo;ice edge jets.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;" data-action-deadline="" data-action-completed="10/4/2019" data-action-contacts="[{&quot;id&quot;:279,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Christine Mataya&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:&quot;/members/people/286&quot;}]">

This project proposes to build drifting buoys making precise measurements of sea surface height (SSH) and Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) content.

Historically, the ice-covered Arctic Ocean has been poorly observed, particularly in winter. The Ice-Tethered Profiler instrument (ITP), developed at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 2003-4, is designed to sample the upper Arctic Ocean water properties and sea ice motion in all seasons and transmit those data to shore-side users in real time. To date, approximately 100 ITP systems have been deployed in the Arctic (each operating for 1-3 years) that have collectively returned more than 70,000 observations of Arctic Ocean water properties as well as nearly 150 cumulative years of ice drift data. The present research project will continue this activity for a 5-year period, as sustained observations are considered vital to documenting and understanding the rapid changes now underway in the Arctic and predicting its future evolution. A three-pronged effort is planned that consists of 1) annual deployment of conventional ITPs, 2) development, testing and then operational deployments of a new instrument, the Tethered Ocean Profiler (TOP) that focuses on the upper 100 200 m of the water column, and 3) scientific analysis of the resulting ITP and TOP data.

Nature Comm., 9, 5017, doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-07061-9.Abstract: Rapid and, in many cases, unprecedented Arctic climate changes are having far-reaching impacts on natural and human systems. Despite state-of-the-art climate models capturing the rapid nature of Arctic climate change, termed Arctic amplification, they significantly disagree on its magnitude. Using a regional, process-oriented surface energy budget analysis, we argue that differences in seasonal energy exchanges in sea ice retreat regions via increased absorption and storage of sunlight in summer and increased upward surface turbulent fluxes in fall/winter contribute to the inter-model spread. Models able to more widely disperse energy drawn from the surface in sea ice retreat regions warm more, suggesting that differences in the local Arctic atmospheric circulation response contribute to the inter-model spread. We find that the principle mechanisms driving the inter-model spread in Arctic amplification operate locally on regional scales, requiring an improved understanding of atmosphere-ocean-sea ice interactions in sea ice retreat regions to reduce the spread.</p>\r\n<p><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\" data-hasqtip=\"1\">NASA</abbr>-funded Principal Investigator published the following paper of relevance to this performance element: Liu, Z. and Schweiger, A. (2019), Low level and surface wind jets near sea ice edge in the Beaufort Sea in late autumn, J. Geophys. Res., early online publication, doi:10.1029/2018JD029770. Abstract: Low‐level wind jets (LLJs) and strong surface winds are frequently observed near the sea ice edge in the presence of strong thermal contrast between open water and sea ice. Two LLJ cases near the sea ice edge in the Beaufort Sea are examined using dropsonde observations made from Seasonal Ice Zone Reconnaissance Survey flights. Ensembles of Polar Weather Research and Forecast simulations with and without sea ice demonstrate the contribution of the surface thermal contrast to the boundary layer structure, the LLJ, and surface ice edge jets. Because the surface temperature contrast only influences the lower most hundreds of meters in the atmospheric boundary layer, its contribution to the temperature gradient and wind speed at the level of the LLJ is limited. The sea ice does strengthen the LLJ by extending the LLJ northward over sea ice and increasing the maximum LLJ wind speeds by up to 13% and as much as 29% further north at a lower altitude. However, the primary reason for the observed strong winds in these two cases are the synoptic interactions between anticyclones and approaching cyclones. The effect of the surface thermal contrast on surface winds is controlled by a separate mechanism. The cold and stable boundary layer over sea ice prevents the momentum transport from the LLJ to the surface. This leads to weaker surface winds over sea ice and confines the strong surface winds close to the sea ice edge. This mechanism contributes to the frequent occurrence of the surface &ldquo;ice edge jets.&rdquo;</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"10/4/2019","completed":"October 4, 2019","followupvalue":"20191004","id":2229,"users":[{"id":279,"name":"Christine Mataya","link":"/members/people/286"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","October 4, 2019"]}},{"milestone":218,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"May 21, 2020","shortdate":"5/21/2020","datevalue":"20200521","action":"<p><strong><span>Physical Oceanography Self-forming Team (<a href=\"/members/documents/16798\">Notes</a>)</span></strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em><span>Topic:<span>&nbsp;</span></span></em><span>Physical Oceanography Self-forming Team (POST) Inaugural Meeting</span></li>\r\n<li><em>Presentation:&nbsp;</em><span><a href=\"/members/documents/16799\">Introducing POST</a><em><span>&nbsp;</span>(slides)</em></span>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>What other organizations are you involved in and how do their goals overlap with, or complement<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-118\">IARPC</abbr>&rsquo;s POST?</li>\r\n<li>What activities or accomplishments would make POST useful to you and your research?</li>\r\n<li>What topics would you like to see covered?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><em><span>Highlights:&nbsp;</span></em><span>The POST inaugural meeting was met by much interest from the meeting participants and there were many suggestions of other organizations to include in the POST effort.

Wave‐ice interactions create the marginal ice zone (MIZ), a region critically important for ecology, transportation, and the polar energy budget. Typically, the MIZ is defined using satellite products as those regions where sea ice concentration is between 15% and 80%. Here we present a new technique to observe ocean surface waves in sea ice, leveraging NASA's ICESat‐2 satellite laser altimeter, and produce maps of wave‐affected sea ice regions in both hemispheres. Defining a new wave‐based metric for MIZ extent, we find that compared to a concentration‐based metric, wave‐based MIZ estimates are smaller. Further, the wave‐affected MIZ makes up a larger fraction of sea ice extent in winter than in summer, opposite to the seasonal cycle of concentration‐based MIZ.</p>\r\n<p>A study looking at the changing energetics of the Beaufort Gyre:<br />Armitage, T.

The mechanisms proposed to explain the stabilization involve either mesoscale eddy activity that opposes Ekman pumping or the reduction of Ekman pumping due to reduced sea ice&ndash;ocean surface stress. However, the relative importance of these mechanisms is unclear. Here, we present observational estimates of the Beaufort Gyre mechanical energy budget and show that energy dissipation and freshwater content stabilization by eddies increased in the late-2000s. The loss of sea ice and acceleration of ocean currents after 2007 resulted in enhanced mechanical energy input but without corresponding increases in potential energy storage. To balance the energy surplus, eddy dissipation and its role in gyre stabilization must have increased after 2007. Our results imply that declining Arctic sea ice will lead to an increasingly energetic Beaufort Gyre with eddies playing a greater role in its stabilization.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"","completed":"","followupvalue":"","id":2509,"users":[],"followup":null}];

&lt;p&gt;Sept 2019: ICESat‐2 Surface Height and Sea IceFreeboard Assessed WithATMLidar Acquisitions From Operation IceBridge in JGR by authors R Kwok, S Kacimi, T Markus, N.T. Kurtz, M. Studinger, J. G. Sonntag, S.S. Manizade, L.N. Boisvert, J.P. Harbeck&lt;br /&gt;Abstract: Surface height and total freeboard from the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite‐2 (ICESat‐2, IS‐2) sea ice data products (ATL07/ATL10) are assessed with near‐coincident retrievals from the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) lidar in four dedicated underflights during the 2019 Operation IceBridge Arctic deployment. Over a mix of seasonal and older ice, we find remarkable correlations between the ATM and IS‐2 height profiles and roughness (in ninety‐nine 10‐km segments) that averages to &amp;gt;0.95 and &amp;gt; 0.97, respectively. Regression slopes near unity, between 0.93 and 0.99, indicate close agreement of the height estimates. Larger differences between the surface heights are seen in rougher areas where it is more difficult for the photon heights (used in IS‐2 surface finding) to capture the surface distributions at short length scales. Total freeboard in 10‐km segments, calculated using three different approaches, show variability of 0.02 to 0.04 m. Sources of residual variance, attributable to differences between the two instruments, are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

In the 2019 summer, area‐averaged freeboard decreased from 34 cm prior to melt to a minimum of 12 cm in August while the area‐averaged albedo decreased from ~0.7 to 0.38 for the same period. Calculations using ICESat‐2 freeboards and modeled ice thickness from Pan‐Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) give area‐averaged snow depths ranging from 17 cm prior to melt to 3 cm in August over seasonal ice and from 34 to 4 cm over multiyear ice. Mean rates of snow ablation (including evaporation) in mid‐June were as high as 2 cm/day, comparable to field records from other years. Increases in freeboard after mid‐August in the high latitude (&amp;gt;80&amp;deg;N) multiyear ice cover, north of the Greenland coast, are likely due to earlier freeze‐up and snow accumulation in these regions with shorter melt seasons.&lt;/p&gt;" data-action-deadline="" data-action-completed="" data-action-contacts="[]">

&lt;p&gt;As the Leg 4 ICE Team Leader, Melinda Webster successfully coordinated and led a team of 14 sea-ice scientists on the MOSAiC expedition during May &amp;ndash; August 2020. Snow and sea-ice measurements during PS122 Leg 4 continued the MOSAiC sea-ice program, with the expansion of the optics program and addition of cross-disciplinary activities. These measurements focused on characterizing the following components of the Arctic sea-ice system during the melt season:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Energy budget: solar partitioning in snow and sea ice, heat fluxes &amp;bull; Mass balance: snow, sea ice, and melt pond thickness distributions*, freshwater fluxes &amp;bull; Dynamics: ice motion, deformation &amp;bull; Remote sensing: up-scaling ground measurements to airborne and satellite footprints, validation &amp;bull; Process-oriented system observations: air/snow/ice/ocean physics-biogeochemistry-ecosystem interactions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suite of information from the Arctic melt season will serve as a launching point for improving process-understanding of the Arctic system and components therein, and provide pathways for future model development and improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Specific to the New Investigator Program project, Webster carried out thickness distribution and optics measurements during Leg 4, collecting time-series data on snow, the surface scattering layer, sea ice, and melt ponds as they evolved over the course of the melt season. These time-series data sets will be invaluable for improving the interpretation and capability of ICESat-2 data for sea-ice research during the summer melt season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Identifying the mechanisms controlling the timing and magnitude of snow accumulation on sea ice is crucial for understanding snow&amp;rsquo;s net effect on the surface energy budget and sea ice mass balance. Here, we analyze the role of cyclone activity on the seasonal buildup of snow on Arctic sea ice using model, satellite, and in situ data over 1979&amp;ndash;2016. On average, 44% of the variability in monthly snow accumulation was controlled by cyclone snowfall and 29% by sea-ice freeze-up. However, there were strong spatio-temporal differences. Cyclone snowfall comprised ~50% of total snowfall in the Pacific compared to 83% in the Atlantic.&lt;br /&gt;While cyclones are stronger in the Atlantic, Pacific snow accumulation is more sensitive to cyclone strength. These findings highlight the heterogeneity in atmosphere-snow-ice interactions across the Arctic, and emphasize the need to scrutinize mechanisms governing cyclone activity to better understand their effects on the Arctic snow-ice system with anthropogenic warming.&lt;/p&gt;

The NASA Eulerian Snow On Sea Ice Model (NESOSIM) is a new, open-source snow budget model that is currently configured to produce daily estimates of the depth and density of snow on sea ice across the Arctic Ocean through the accumulation season. NESOSIM has been developed in a three-dimensional Eulerian framework and includes two (vertical) snow layers and several simple parameterizations (accumulation, wind packing, advection&amp;ndash;divergence, blowing snow lost to leads) to represent key sources and sinks of snow on sea ice. The model is forced with daily inputs of snowfall and near-surface winds (from reanalyses), sea ice concentration (from satellite passive microwave data) and sea ice drift (from satellite feature tracking) during the accumulation season (August through April). In this study, we present the NESOSIM formulation, calibration efforts, sensitivity studies and validation efforts across an Arctic Ocean domain (100&amp;thinsp;km horizontal resolution). The simulated snow depth and density are calibrated with in situ data collected on drifting ice stations during the 1980s. NESOSIM shows strong agreement with the in situ seasonal cycles of snow depth and density, and shows good (moderate) agreement with the regional snow depth (density) distributions. NESOSIM is run for a contemporary period (2000 to 2015), with the results showing strong sensitivity to the reanalysis-derived snowfall forcing data, with the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) and the Japanese Meteorological Agency 55-year reanalysis (JRA-55) forced snow depths generally higher than ERA-Interim, and the Arctic System Reanalysis (ASR) generally lower. We also generate and force NESOSIM with a consensus &amp;ldquo;median&amp;rdquo; daily snowfall dataset from these reanalyses. The results are compared against snow depth estimates derived from NASA&#39;s Operation IceBridge (OIB) snow radar data from 2009 to 2015, showing moderate&amp;ndash;strong correlations and root mean squared errors of &amp;thinsp;&amp;sim;&amp;thinsp;10&amp;thinsp;cm depending on the OIB snow depth product analyzed, similar to the comparisons between OIB snow depths and the commonly used modified Warren snow depth climatology.

The NASA Eulerian Snow On Sea Ice Model (NESOSIM) is a new, open-source snow budget model that is currently configured to produce daily estimates of the depth and density of snow on sea ice across the Arctic Ocean through the accumulation season. NESOSIM has been developed in a three-dimensional Eulerian framework and includes two (vertical) snow layers and several simple parameterizations (accumulation, wind packing, advection–divergence, blowing snow lost to leads) to represent key sources and sinks of snow on sea ice. The model is forced with daily inputs of snowfall and near-surface winds (from reanalyses), sea ice concentration (from satellite passive microwave data) and sea ice drift (from satellite feature tracking) during the accumulation season (August through April). In this study, we present the NESOSIM formulation, calibration efforts, sensitivity studies and validation efforts across an Arctic Ocean domain (100 km horizontal resolution). The simulated snow depth and density are calibrated with in situ data collected on drifting ice stations during the 1980s. NESOSIM shows strong agreement with the in situ seasonal cycles of snow depth and density, and shows good (moderate) agreement with the regional snow depth (density) distributions.

We also generate and force NESOSIM with a consensus “median” daily snowfall dataset from these reanalyses. The results are compared against snow depth estimates derived from NASA's Operation IceBridge (OIB) snow radar data from 2009 to 2015, showing moderate–strong correlations and root mean squared errors of  ∼ 10 cm depending on the OIB snow depth product analyzed, similar to the comparisons between OIB snow depths and the commonly used modified Warren snow depth climatology. Potential improvements to this initial NESOSIM formulation are discussed in the hopes of improving the accuracy and reliability of these simulated snow depths and densities.</p><p></p>

Climate models do not accurately simulate these processes, and have large variability in simulating sea-ice change, drift and lead opening. We aim to improve the rheological component of sea-ice models. This rheology controls the relationship between wind and current forcing on the ice pack and its deformation, which controls the ice motion. We have identified along-shore boundary conditions needed for accurate simulation of ice drift. In light of our recent advances in our understanding of the mechanical control of ice motion in the Beaufort Gyre, we anticipate model improvements will allow constraint of future climate projections of Arctic sea ice. &amp;nbsp;We propose to use satellite and airborne imagery of the Arctic ice pack to identify the modes of failure that result in leads and ridges forming. Our previous work has identified lead pattern geometry aligns with Mohr-Coulomb theory (a rheological model). We will catalog 38 years of clear sky satellite sea-ice imagery by fracture pattern, and use ice drift and deformation products to further classify by mode of failure (e.g. failure in tension, shear or compression). We will extend previous work by using available ice tracking products, in particular the RADARSat Geophysical Processing System (RGPS) ice deformation products, to identify compressive modes of failure, and to extend beyond the clear sky database. A subset of high-resolution airborne imagery from Operation Ice Bridge (OIB) will be used to verify if particular failure modes are fully resolved in lowerresolution satellite imagery. &amp;nbsp;The catalog of classified failure patterns will be searched for case studies captured close to the time of failure. We will perform stress analysis on these case studies, initially assuming a Mohr-Coulomb rheology. Identifying if there are consistent parameters in the rheological model across the case studies, or if these parameters vary seasonally, by ice type, or confinement (applied stress) on the ice pack. This information will be used to identify appropriate rheological models for pack ice. Which will be tested in a standalone sea-ice model. Our previous work has identified the importance of the landfast ice edge in the location of large scale lead patterns. We will test such boundary conditions in the model, along with exploring how the ice state responds to modifications to rheological models our observational study finds necessary. &amp;nbsp;We address the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Cryosphere Program long-term goals of using remote sensing products to validate and improve models of changes in sea-ice cover.

Climate models do not accurately simulate these processes, and have large variability in simulating sea-ice change, drift and lead opening. We aim to improve the rheological component of sea-ice models. This rheology controls the relationship between wind and current forcing on the ice pack and its deformation, which controls the ice motion. We have identified along-shore boundary conditions needed for accurate simulation of ice drift. In light of our recent advances in our understanding of the mechanical control of ice motion in the Beaufort Gyre, we anticipate model improvements will allow constraint of future climate projections of Arctic sea ice. &nbsp;We propose to use satellite and airborne imagery of the Arctic ice pack to identify the modes of failure that result in leads and ridges forming. Our previous work has identified lead pattern geometry aligns with Mohr-Coulomb theory (a rheological model). We will catalog 38 years of clear sky satellite sea-ice imagery by fracture pattern, and use ice drift and deformation products to further classify by mode of failure (e.g. failure in tension, shear or compression). We will extend previous work by using available ice tracking products, in particular the RADARSat Geophysical Processing System (RGPS) ice deformation products, to identify compressive modes of failure, and to extend beyond the clear sky database. A subset of high-resolution airborne imagery from Operation Ice Bridge (OIB) will be used to verify if particular failure modes are fully resolved in lowerresolution satellite imagery. &nbsp;The catalog of classified failure patterns will be searched for case studies captured close to the time of failure. We will perform stress analysis on these case studies, initially assuming a Mohr-Coulomb rheology. Identifying if there are consistent parameters in the rheological model across the case studies, or if these parameters vary seasonally, by ice type, or confinement (applied stress) on the ice pack. This information will be used to identify appropriate rheological models for pack ice. Which will be tested in a standalone sea-ice model. Our previous work has identified the importance of the landfast ice edge in the location of large scale lead patterns. We will test such boundary conditions in the model, along with exploring how the ice state responds to modifications to rheological models our observational study finds necessary. &nbsp;We address the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\">NASA</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>Cryosphere Program long-term goals of using remote sensing products to validate and improve models of changes in sea-ice cover. We will identify physical properties, in particular material properties, of pack ice and incorporate these into sea-ice models. This work is needed to determine the mechanisms controlling recent observed reductions in sea ice thickness in the Arctic. We utilize<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\">NASA</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>remote sensed and OIB data to improve models of sea-ice motion, opening and ridging. This will better constrain sea-ice drift and deformation, and associated feedbacks, in climate projections. &nbsp;Project outcomes will include model improvements to be shared with the sea-ice community through publications and conference presentation.

Model Dev., 11, 4577&ndash;4602, 2018 https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-4577-2018<br />Abstract. The NASA Eulerian Snow On Sea Ice Model (NESOSIM) is a new, open-source snow budget model that is currently configured to produce daily estimates of the depth and density of snow on sea ice across the Arctic Ocean through the accumulation season. NESOSIM has been developed in a three-dimensional Eulerian framework and includes two (vertical) snow layers and several simple parameterizations (accumulation, wind packing, advection&ndash;divergence, blowing snow lost to leads) to represent key sources and sinks of snow on sea ice. The model is forced with daily inputs of snowfall and near-surface winds (from reanalyses), sea ice concentration (from satellite passive microwave data) and sea ice drift (from satellite feature tracking) during the accumulation season (August through April). In this study, we present the NESOSIM formulation, calibration efforts, sensitivity studies and validation efforts across an Arctic Ocean domain (100&thinsp;km horizontal resolution). The simulated snow depth and density are calibrated with in situ data collected on drifting ice stations during the 1980s. NESOSIM shows strong agreement with the in situ seasonal cycles of snow depth and density, and shows good (moderate) agreement with the regional snow depth (density) distributions. NESOSIM is run for a contemporary period (2000 to 2015), with the results showing strong sensitivity to the reanalysis-derived snowfall forcing data, with the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) and the Japanese Meteorological Agency 55-year reanalysis (JRA-55) forced snow depths generally higher than ERA-Interim, and the Arctic System Reanalysis (ASR) generally lower. We also generate and force NESOSIM with a consensus &ldquo;median&rdquo; daily snowfall dataset from these reanalyses. The results are compared against snow depth estimates derived from NASA's Operation IceBridge (OIB) snow radar data from 2009 to 2015, showing moderate&ndash;strong correlations and root mean squared errors of &thinsp;&sim;&thinsp;10&thinsp;cm depending on the OIB snow depth product analyzed, similar to the comparisons between OIB snow depths and the commonly used modified Warren snow depth climatology. Potential improvements to this initial NESOSIM formulation are discussed in the hopes of improving the accuracy and reliability of these simulated snow depths and densities.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"","completed":"","followupvalue":"","id":2138,"users":[],"followup":null},{"milestone":264,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"September 27, 2019","shortdate":"9/27/2019","datevalue":"20190927","action":"<p><span>Sea Ice and Modeling February 25th Meeting (</span><a href=\"/members/documents/12987\"><span>Agenda</span></a><span>,</span><a href=\"/members/documents/13088\"><span>Notes</span></a><span>,&nbsp;</span><a href=\"/members/events/12681\"><span>Recordings</span></a><span>):</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span>Topic:&nbsp;</span><a href=\"/members/events/12681\"><span>Sea Ice Model<span>&nbsp;</span>Intercomparison<span>&nbsp;</span>Project 6 (SIMIP6): Sea Ice and Modeling Joint Collaboration Team</span></a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span>Presentations:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><a href=\"/members/documents/13051\"><span>SIMIP6- Sea Ice Model<span>&nbsp;</span>Intercomaprison<span>&nbsp;</span>Project for&nbsp;CMIP6&nbsp;</span></a><span>-&nbsp;</span><a href=\"/members/people/2068\"><span>Alex<span>&nbsp;</span>Jahn</span></a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><a href=\"/members/documents/13053\"><span>National Center for Atmospheric Research Perspective</span></a><span>-&nbsp;</span><a href=\"/members/people/9362\"><span>David Bailey</span></a><span>(NCAR)</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><a href=\"/members/documents/13047\"><span>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Perspective</span></a><span>-&nbsp;</span><a href=\"/members/people/12983\"><span>Michael<span>&nbsp;</span>Winton</span></a><span>&nbsp;(NOAA)</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span>Highlights:&nbsp;</span><span>Information on&nbsp;CMIP6&nbsp;from several different perspectives were explored.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span><span>Relevant Links:</span></span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span>Early Career Faculty Innovator Program:&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://ncar.ucar.edu/what-we-offer/education-outreach/early-career-opportunities\"><span>https://ncar.ucar.edu/what-we-offer/education-outreach/early-career-opportunities</span></a><span>.

Here, we analyze the role of cyclone activity on the seasonal buildup of snow on Arctic sea ice using model, satellite, and in situ data over 1979&ndash;2016. On average, 44% of the variability in monthly snow accumulation was controlled by cyclone snowfall and 29% by sea-ice freeze-up. However, there were strong spatio-temporal differences. Cyclone snowfall comprised ~50% of total snowfall in the Pacific compared to 83% in the Atlantic.<br />While cyclones are stronger in the Atlantic, Pacific snow accumulation is more sensitive to cyclone strength. These findings highlight the heterogeneity in atmosphere-snow-ice interactions across the Arctic, and emphasize the need to scrutinize mechanisms governing cyclone activity to better understand their effects on the Arctic snow-ice system with anthropogenic warming.</p>\r\n<p>NASA&nbsp;previously provided in an update that&nbsp;NASA-funded researchers published the following paper in JGR in Sept 2019: ICESat‐2 Surface Height and Sea IceFreeboard Assessed WithATMLidar Acquisitions From OperationIceBridge inJGR by authors R Kwok, S Kacimi, T Markus, N.T.

Harbeck<br />Abstract: Surface height and total freeboard from the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite‐2 (ICESat‐2, IS‐2) sea ice data products (ATL07/ATL10) are assessed with near‐coincident retrievals from the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) lidar in four dedicated underflights during the 2019 Operation IceBridge Arctic deployment. Over a mix of seasonal and older ice, we find remarkable correlations between the ATM and IS‐2 height profiles and roughness (in ninety‐nine 10‐km segments) that averages to &gt;0.95 and &gt; 0.97, respectively. Regression slopes near unity, between 0.93 and 0.99, indicate close agreement of the height estimates. Larger differences between the surface heights are seen in rougher areas where it is more difficult for the photon heights (used in IS‐2 surface finding) to capture the surface distributions at short length scales. Total freeboard in 10‐km segments, calculated using three different approaches, show variability of 0.02 to 0.04 m. Sources of residual variance, attributable to differences between the two instruments, are discussed.</p>\r\n<p>Kwok, R., G. F. Cunningham, S.

In the 2019 summer, area‐averaged freeboard decreased from 34 cm prior to melt to a minimum of 12 cm in August while the area‐averaged albedo decreased from ~0.7 to 0.38 for the same period. Calculations using ICESat‐2 freeboards and modeled ice thickness from Pan‐Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) give area‐averaged snow depths ranging from 17 cm prior to melt to 3 cm in August over seasonal ice and from 34 to 4 cm over multiyear ice. Mean rates of snow ablation (including evaporation) in mid‐June were as high as 2 cm/day, comparable to field records from other years. Increases in freeboard after mid‐August in the high latitude (&gt;80&deg;N) multiyear ice cover, north of the Greenland coast, are likely due to earlier freeze‐up and snow accumulation in these regions with shorter melt seasons.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"","completed":"","followupvalue":"","id":2522,"users":[],"followup":null}];

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Twin 5-month seasonal forecast experiments are performed to predict the September 2018 mean and minimum ice extent using the fully coupled Navy Earth System Prediction Capability (ESPC). In the control run, ensemble forecasts are initialized from the operational US Navy Global Ocean Forecasting System (GOFS) 3.1 but do not assimilate ice thickness data. Another set of forecasts are initialized from the same GOFS 3.1 fields but with sea ice thickness derived from CryoSat-2 (CS2). The Navy ESPC ensemble mean September 2018 minimum sea ice extent initialized with GOFS 3.1 ice thickness was over-predicted by 0.68 M km2 (5.27 M km2) vs the ensemble forecasts initialized with CS2 ice thickness that had an error of 0.40 M km2 (4.99 M km2), a 43% reduction in error. The September mean integrated ice edge error shows a 18% improvement for the Pan-Arctic with the CS2 data vs the control forecasts. Comparison against upward looking sonar ice thickness in the Beaufort Sea reveals a lower bias and RMSE with the CS2 forecasts at all three moorings. Ice concentration at these locations is also improved, but neither set of forecasts show ice free conditions as observed at moorings A and D.&lt;/p&gt;

Climate models do not accurately simulate these processes, and have large variability in simulating sea-ice change, drift and lead opening. We aim to improve the rheological component of sea-ice models. This rheology controls the relationship between wind and current forcing on the ice pack and its deformation, which controls the ice motion. We have identified along-shore boundary conditions needed for accurate simulation of ice drift. In light of our recent advances in our understanding of the mechanical control of ice motion in the Beaufort Gyre, we anticipate model improvements will allow constraint of future climate projections of Arctic sea ice. &amp;nbsp;We propose to use satellite and airborne imagery of the Arctic ice pack to identify the modes of failure that result in leads and ridges forming. Our previous work has identified lead pattern geometry aligns with Mohr-Coulomb theory (a rheological model). We will catalog 38 years of clear sky satellite sea-ice imagery by fracture pattern, and use ice drift and deformation products to further classify by mode of failure (e.g. failure in tension, shear or compression). We will extend previous work by using available ice tracking products, in particular the RADARSat Geophysical Processing System (RGPS) ice deformation products, to identify compressive modes of failure, and to extend beyond the clear sky database. A subset of high-resolution airborne imagery from Operation Ice Bridge (OIB) will be used to verify if particular failure modes are fully resolved in lowerresolution satellite imagery. &amp;nbsp;The catalog of classified failure patterns will be searched for case studies captured close to the time of failure. We will perform stress analysis on these case studies, initially assuming a Mohr-Coulomb rheology. Identifying if there are consistent parameters in the rheological model across the case studies, or if these parameters vary seasonally, by ice type, or confinement (applied stress) on the ice pack. This information will be used to identify appropriate rheological models for pack ice. Which will be tested in a standalone sea-ice model. Our previous work has identified the importance of the landfast ice edge in the location of large scale lead patterns. We will test such boundary conditions in the model, along with exploring how the ice state responds to modifications to rheological models our observational study finds necessary. &amp;nbsp;We address the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Cryosphere Program long-term goals of using remote sensing products to validate and improve models of changes in sea-ice cover. We will identify physical properties, in particular material properties, of pack ice and incorporate these into sea-ice models. This work is needed to determine the mechanisms controlling recent observed reductions in sea ice thickness in the Arctic. We utilize&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;remote sensed and OIB data to improve models of sea-ice motion, opening and ridging. This will better constrain sea-ice drift and deformation, and associated feedbacks, in climate projections. &amp;nbsp;Project outcomes will include model improvements to be shared with the sea-ice community through publications and conference presentation.

Climate models do not accurately simulate these processes, and have large variability in simulating sea-ice change, drift and lead opening. We aim to improve the rheological component of sea-ice models. This rheology controls the relationship between wind and current forcing on the ice pack and its deformation, which controls the ice motion. We have identified along-shore boundary conditions needed for accurate simulation of ice drift. In light of our recent advances in our understanding of the mechanical control of ice motion in the Beaufort Gyre, we anticipate model improvements will allow constraint of future climate projections of Arctic sea ice. &nbsp;We propose to use satellite and airborne imagery of the Arctic ice pack to identify the modes of failure that result in leads and ridges forming. Our previous work has identified lead pattern geometry aligns with Mohr-Coulomb theory (a rheological model). We will catalog 38 years of clear sky satellite sea-ice imagery by fracture pattern, and use ice drift and deformation products to further classify by mode of failure (e.g. failure in tension, shear or compression). We will extend previous work by using available ice tracking products, in particular the RADARSat Geophysical Processing System (RGPS) ice deformation products, to identify compressive modes of failure, and to extend beyond the clear sky database. A subset of high-resolution airborne imagery from Operation Ice Bridge (OIB) will be used to verify if particular failure modes are fully resolved in lowerresolution satellite imagery. &nbsp;The catalog of classified failure patterns will be searched for case studies captured close to the time of failure. We will perform stress analysis on these case studies, initially assuming a Mohr-Coulomb rheology. Identifying if there are consistent parameters in the rheological model across the case studies, or if these parameters vary seasonally, by ice type, or confinement (applied stress) on the ice pack. This information will be used to identify appropriate rheological models for pack ice. Which will be tested in a standalone sea-ice model. Our previous work has identified the importance of the landfast ice edge in the location of large scale lead patterns. We will test such boundary conditions in the model, along with exploring how the ice state responds to modifications to rheological models our observational study finds necessary. &nbsp;We address the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\">NASA</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>Cryosphere Program long-term goals of using remote sensing products to validate and improve models of changes in sea-ice cover. We will identify physical properties, in particular material properties, of pack ice and incorporate these into sea-ice models.

We utilize<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\">NASA</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>remote sensed and OIB data to improve models of sea-ice motion, opening and ridging. This will better constrain sea-ice drift and deformation, and associated feedbacks, in climate projections. &nbsp;Project outcomes will include model improvements to be shared with the sea-ice community through publications and conference presentation.

In the control run, ensemble forecasts are initialized from the operational US Navy Global Ocean Forecasting System (GOFS) 3.1 but do not assimilate ice thickness data. Another set of forecasts are initialized from the same GOFS 3.1 fields but with sea ice thickness derived from CryoSat-2 (CS2). The Navy ESPC ensemble mean September 2018 minimum sea ice extent initialized with GOFS 3.1 ice thickness was over-predicted by 0.68 M km2 (5.27 M km2) vs the ensemble forecasts initialized with CS2 ice thickness that had an error of 0.40 M km2 (4.99 M km2), a 43% reduction in error. The September mean integrated ice edge error shows a 18% improvement for the Pan-Arctic with the CS2 data vs the control forecasts. Comparison against upward looking sonar ice thickness in the Beaufort Sea reveals a lower bias and RMSE with the CS2 forecasts at all three moorings.

<li>There are possible links between sea ice and HABs. The<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-212">SICT</abbr>leadership will pursue discussions around these possible links and help to make connections between researchers.</li>
<li>Danielle noted that the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-414">MECT</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-422">MST</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>are continuing discussions around advancing biogeochemical models.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Arctic poses unique challenges to safe maritime operations, including hazards associated with extreme weather and sea ice. Improving situational awareness is a critical element in supporting planning and emergency response. This research explores the opportunities and challenges associated with leveraging arctic system science research to coproduce sea ice decision support tools. The research is based on information derived from a coastal radar operated as part of university research in Utqiaġvik, Alaska as well as interviews with marine operators and responders, subsistence users, and service providers.

&lt;li&gt;Community round table discussion around the record low ice conditions in the Bering Sea Ice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine how the IARPC Collaboration Teams can act together to facilitate community-wide interaction around major events (e.g., shaping research needs)&lt;/li&gt;

The model initialized with CryoSat-2 ice thickness exhibits skill in simulating ice thickness from the initial period to up to 6 months. We find that the largest improvements in ice thickness occur over multi-year ice. Based on the data periods examined here, we find that for the 18-month study period, when compared with upward looking sonar measurements, the CryoSat-2 reanalyses show significant improvement in bias (0.47&amp;ndash;0.75) and RMSE (0.89&amp;ndash;1.04) versus the control run without these data (1.44 and 1.60, respectively).

The model initialized with CryoSat-2 ice thickness exhibits skill in simulating ice thickness from the initial period to up to 6 months. We find that the largest improvements in ice thickness occur over multi-year ice. Based on the data periods examined here, we find that for the 18-month study period, when compared with upward looking sonar measurements, the CryoSat-2 reanalyses show significant improvement in bias (0.47–0.75) and RMSE (0.89–1.04) versus the control run without these data (1.44 and 1.60, respectively).
