Given the breadth of service\narea and the delivery of relevant programs and content in the Subsistence Sciences, the\nCollaborative is well positioned to strengthen the development and sustainability of rural\nAlaskan villages. In addition, the integration of indigenous knowledge from students and\ncommunity members in the Subsistence Sciences keeps the programs specifically\napplicable to rural Alaska in these days of changing economic, social and environmental\nconditions.Out migration from Alaskan villages to transportation hubs or urban centers\nthreaten their viability. The economies of most rural villages are such that few year-round\ncash jobs are available, leading many young people to seek opportunities in urban Alaska.\nDependence upon refined fossil fuels and skyrocketing energy costs have created hardships\nfor rural residents. The Alaska Native population as a whole is experiencing increasing\nhealth issues. According to a 2014 study by the State of Alaska Department of Health and\nSocial Services, 35 percent of the Alaska Native population is considered obese, up from 20\npercent in the 1990&#39;s. Poor dental health is endemic in rural villages, occasioned by\nchanging eating habits as well as lack of dental care. The incidence of diabetes among\nAlaska Natives doubled between 1985 and 1999. Based on these and other factors, the\nAlaska Native Policy Center identified energy and food economies and jobs as important to\nthe future of rural Alaska. A report by the First Alaskan Institute identified the need for\nstrong, committed, knowledgeable and caring leadership at all levels of life if Alaska Natives\nare going to successfully address the issues facing rural communities. With 24 years as the\nmedian age of the Alaska Native population, the issue of education, employment, customary\nand traditional use of resources and Native leadership are paramount.The activities of the\nDrumbeats Alaska Collaborative AN/NH grant will address the problem of the viability of\nrural Alaskan villages by 1) preparing students for place-based employment; 2) help\ncommunities to increase food security, including subsistence food gathering; and 3) assist\nrural residents to reduce the high cost-of-living through energy savings.The rural campuses\nin the Drumbeats Alaska Collaborative can help develop a cadre of local expertise and\nleaders through training, education and research programs built around the subsistence\nsciences.With project longevity, the word is spreading about the programs and projects and\nthe number of community members and students who participate in workshops and\nsymposiums is increasing for the practical and relevant knowledge they deliver. The formal\nand informal information increasingly integrating indigenous ways of knowing with science\nleads to increased participation and ideas to resolve local, regional and state issues related\nto food and energy security and resource stewardship. The growing collaboration between\nprograms expands these knowledges.

The economies of most rural villages are such that few year-round&amp;nbsp;cash jobs are available, leading many young people to seek opportunities in urban Alaska.&amp;nbsp;Dependence upon refined fossil fuels and skyrocketing energy costs have created hardships&amp;nbsp;for rural residents. The Alaska Native population as a whole is experiencing increasing&amp;nbsp;health issues. According to a 2014 study by the State of Alaska Department of Health and&amp;nbsp;Social Services, 35 percent of the Alaska Native population is considered obese, up from 20&amp;nbsp;percent in the 1990&#39;s. Poor dental health is endemic in rural villages, occasioned by&amp;nbsp;changing eating habits as well as lack of dental care. The incidence of diabetes among&amp;nbsp;Alaska Natives doubled between 1985 and 1999. Based on these and other factors, the&amp;nbsp;Alaska Native Policy Center identified energy and food economies and jobs as important to&amp;nbsp;the future of rural Alaska. A report by the First Alaskan Institute identified the need for&amp;nbsp;strong, committed, knowledgeable and caring leadership at all levels of life if Alaska Natives&amp;nbsp;are going to successfully address the issues facing rural communities. With 24 years as the&amp;nbsp;median age of the Alaska Native population, the issue of education, employment, customary&amp;nbsp;and traditional use of resources and Native leadership are paramount. The activities of the&lt;br /&gt;Drumbeats Alaska Collaborative AN/NH grant will address the problem of the viability of&amp;nbsp;rural Alaskan villages by 1) preparing students for place-based employment; 2) help&amp;nbsp;communities to increase food security, including subsistence food gathering; and 3) assist&amp;nbsp;rural residents to reduce the high cost-of-living through energy savings. The rural campuses&amp;nbsp;in the Drumbeats Alaska Collaborative can help develop a cadre of local expertise and&amp;nbsp;leaders through training, education and research programs built around the subsistence&amp;nbsp;sciences. With project longevity, the word is spreading about the programs and projects and&amp;nbsp;the number of community members and students who participate in workshops and&lt;br /&gt;symposiums is increasing for the practical and relevant knowledge they deliver.

Environmental Research Letters. 14(1), 010401.&amp;nbsp; https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aaeec1; Abstract: Snow covers Arctic and boreal regions (ABRs) for approximately 9 months of the year, thus snowscapes dominate the form and function of tundra and boreal ecosystems. In recent decades, Arctic warming has changed the snowcover&amp;rsquo;s spatial extent and distribution, as well as its seasonal timing and duration, while also altering the physical characteristics of the snowpack. Understanding the little studied effects of changing snowscapes on its wildlife communities is critical. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the urgent need for, and suggest an approach for developing, an improved suite of temporally evolving, spatially distributed snow products to help understand how dynamics in snowscape properties impact wildlife, with a specific focus on Alaska and northwestern Canada. Via consideration of existing knowledge of wildlife-snow interactions, currently available snow products for focus region, and results of three case studies, we conclude that improving snow science in the ABR will be best achieved by focusing efforts on developing data-model fusion approaches to produce fit for-purpose snow products that include, but are not limited to, wildlife ecology. The relative wealth of coordinated in situ measurements, airborne and satellite remote sensing data, and modeling tools being collected and developed as part of NASA&amp;rsquo;s Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment and SnowEx campaigns, for example, provide a data rich environment for developing and testing new remote sensing algorithms and retrievals of snowscape properties.&lt;/p&gt;

Ecological Applications. 28(7), 1715-1729.&amp;nbsp; doi:10.1002/eap.1773 Abstract: Winters are limiting for many terrestrial animals due to energy deficits brought on by resource scarcity and the increased metabolic costs of thermoregulation and traveling through snow. A better understanding of how animals respond to snow conditions is needed to predict the impacts of climate change on wildlife. We compared the performance of remotely sensed and modeled snow products as predictors of winter movements at multiple spatial and temporal scales using a data set of 20,544 locations from 30 GPS‐collared Dall sheep (Ovis dalli dalli) in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, Alaska, USA from 2005 to 2008. We used daily 500‐m MODIS normalized difference snow index (NDSI), and multi‐resolution snow depth and density outputs from a snowpack evolution model (SnowModel), as covariates in step selection functions. We predicted that modeled snow depth would perform best across all scales of selection due to more informative spatiotemporal variation and relevance to animal movement. Our results indicated that adding any of the evaluated snow metrics substantially improved model performance and helped characterize winter Dall sheep movements. As expected, SnowModel‐simulated snow depth outperformed NDSI at fine‐to‐moderate scales of selection (step scales &amp;lt; 112 h). At the finest scale, Dall sheep selected for snow depths below mean chest height (&amp;lt;54 cm) when in low‐density snows (100 kg/m3), which may have facilitated access to ground forage and reduced energy expenditure while traveling. However, sheep selected for higher snow densities (&amp;gt;300 kg/m3) at snow depths above chest height, which likely further reduced energy expenditure by limiting hoof penetration in deeper snows. At moderate‐to‐coarse scales (112&amp;ndash;896 h step scales), however, NDSI was the best‐performing snow covariate. Thus, the use of publicly available, remotely sensed, snow cover products can substantially improve models of animal movement, particularly in cases where movement distances exceed the MODIS 500‐m grid threshold. However, remote sensing products may require substantial data thinning due to cloud cover, potentially limiting its power in cases where complex models are necessary. Snowpack evolution models such as SnowModel offer users increased flexibility at the expense of added complexity, but can provide critical insights into fine‐scale responses to rapidly changing snow properties.&lt;/p&gt;" data-action-deadline="" data-action-completed="" data-action-contacts="[]">

&lt;p&gt;a. Numerous ABoVE projects have assessed how changing wildlife habitat are impacting key wildlife species in the IARPC domain, including caribou habitats in northeastern Alaska, Alaska&amp;rsquo;s North Slope, and the NWT, nesting habitats in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, and Dall Sheep habitat across its entire range.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;All this research involves direct interactions with local and regional native organizations, including development and carrying out of research activities and consultation regarding information needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. Research is being conducted on how changes to ecosystem and environmental conditions caused by wildfires are impacting access to ecosystem services in Interior Alaska.&amp;nbsp; This research involves collaborations with subsistence harvesters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. One issue identified by the HWB Collaboration Team is to improve the ability to predict the probability of smoke events from wildland fires.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;ABoVE researchers are supporting a cross-cutting activity (between the Atmospheric, TE, and HWB CTs) to improve information on wildland fire smoke.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;ABoVE research on improving wildland fire emissions is discussed in PE 7.3.2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d. The ABoVE Science Team is carrying out a synthesis activity focused on a major scientific data and analysis gap that is specific to Arctic and Boreal regions - the role of snow and snow datasets to enable understanding of wildlife movement &amp;amp; human accessibility to ecosystem services.&lt;/p&gt;

                <p></p><p>ABoVE&nbsp;research supported this Performance Element in the following ways:</p>
<p>a. Numerous ABoVE projects have assessed how changing wildlife habitat are impacting key wildlife species in the IARPC domain, including caribou habitats in northeastern Alaska, Alaska’s North Slope, and the NWT, nesting habitats in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, and Dall Sheep habitat across its entire range.<span>&nbsp; </span>All this research involves direct interactions with local and regional native organizations, including development and carrying out of research activities and consultation regarding information needs.</p>
<p>b. Research is being conducted on how changes to ecosystem and environmental conditions caused by wildfires are impacting access to ecosystem services in Interior Alaska.&nbsp; This research involves collaborations with subsistence harvesters.</p>
<p>c. One issue identified by the HWB Collaboration Team is to improve the ability to predict the probability of smoke events from wildland fires.<span>&nbsp; </span>ABoVE researchers are supporting a cross-cutting activity (between the Atmospheric, TE, and HWB CTs) to improve information on wildland fire smoke.<span>&nbsp; </span>ABoVE research on improving wildland fire emissions is discussed in PE 7.3.2.</p>
<p>d. The ABoVE Science Team is carrying out a synthesis activity focused on a major scientific data and analysis gap that is specific to Arctic and Boreal regions - the role of snow and snow datasets to enable understanding of wildlife movement &amp; human accessibility to ecosystem services.</p>

Numerous ABoVE projects have assessed how changing wildlife habitat are impacting key wildlife species in the IARPC domain, including caribou habitats in northeastern Alaska, Alaska&rsquo;s North Slope, and the NWT, nesting habitats in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, and Dall Sheep habitat across its entire range.<span>&nbsp; </span>All this research involves direct interactions with local and regional native organizations, including development and carrying out of research activities and consultation regarding information needs.</p>\r\n<p>b. Research is being conducted on how changes to ecosystem and environmental conditions caused by wildfires are impacting access to ecosystem services in Interior Alaska.&nbsp; This research involves collaborations with subsistence harvesters.</p>\r\n<p>c. One issue identified by the HWB Collaboration Team is to improve the ability to predict the probability of smoke events from wildland fires.<span>&nbsp; </span>ABoVE researchers are supporting a cross-cutting activity (between the Atmospheric, TE, and HWB CTs) to improve information on wildland fire smoke.<span>&nbsp; </span>ABoVE research on improving wildland fire emissions is discussed in PE 7.3.2.</p>\r\n<p>d. The ABoVE Science Team is carrying out a synthesis activity focused on a major scientific data and analysis gap that is specific to Arctic and Boreal regions - the role of snow and snow datasets to

Integrating snow science and wildlife ecology in Arctic-boreal North America. Environmental Research Letters. 14(1), 010401.&nbsp; https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aaeec1; Abstract: Snow covers Arctic and boreal regions (ABRs) for approximately 9 months of the year, thus snowscapes dominate the form and function of tundra and boreal ecosystems. In recent decades, Arctic warming has changed the snowcover&rsquo;s spatial extent and distribution, as well as its seasonal timing and duration, while also altering the physical characteristics of the snowpack. Understanding the little studied effects of changing snowscapes on its wildlife communities is critical. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the urgent need for, and suggest an approach for developing, an improved suite of temporally evolving, spatially distributed snow products to help understand how dynamics in snowscape properties impact wildlife, with a specific focus on Alaska and northwestern Canada. Via consideration of existing knowledge of wildlife-snow interactions, currently available snow products for focus region, and results of three case studies, we conclude that improving snow science in the ABR will be best achieved by focusing efforts on developing data-model fusion approaches to produce fit for-purpose snow products that include, but are not limited to, wildlife ecology. The relative wealth of coordinated in situ measurements, airborne and satellite remote sensing data, and modeling tools being collected and developed as part of NASA&rsquo;s Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment and SnowEx campaigns, for example, provide a data rich environment for developing and testing new remote sensing algorithms and retrievals of snowscape properties.</p>\r\n<p>Mahoney et al. 2018. Navigating snowscapes: scale-dependent responses of mountain sheep to snowpack properties. Ecological Applications. 28(7), 1715-1729.&nbsp; doi:10.1002/eap.1773 Abstract: Winters are limiting for many terrestrial animals due to energy deficits brought on by resource scarcity and the increased metabolic costs of thermoregulation and traveling through snow. A better understanding of how animals respond to snow conditions is needed to predict the impacts of climate change on wildlife. We compared the performance of remotely sensed and modeled snow products as predictors of winter movements at multiple spatial and temporal scales using a data set of 20,544 locations from 30 GPS‐collared Dall sheep (Ovis dalli dalli) in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, Alaska, USA from 2005 to 2008. We used daily 500‐m MODIS normalized difference snow index (NDSI), and multi‐resolution snow depth and density outputs from a snowpack evolution model (SnowModel), as covariates in step selection functions. We predicted that modeled snow depth would perform best across all scales of selection due to more informative spatiotemporal variation and relevance to animal movement. Our results indicated that adding any of the evaluated snow metrics substantially improved model performance and helped characterize winter Dall sheep movements. As expected, SnowModel‐simulated snow depth outperformed NDSI at fine‐to‐moderate scales of selection (step scales &lt; 112 h). At the finest scale, Dall sheep selected for snow depths below mean chest height (&lt;54 cm) when in low‐density snows (100 kg/m3), which may have facilitated access to ground forage and reduced energy expenditure while traveling. However, sheep selected for higher snow densities (&gt;300 kg/m3) at snow depths above chest height, which likely further reduced energy expenditure by limiting hoof penetration in deeper snows. At moderate‐to‐coarse scales (112&ndash;896 h step scales), however, NDSI was the best‐performing snow covariate. Thus, the use of publicly available, remotely sensed, snow cover products can substantially improve models of animal movement, particularly in cases where movement distances exceed the MODIS 500‐m grid threshold. However, remote sensing products may require substantial data thinning due to cloud cover, potentially limiting its power in cases where complex models are necessary. Snowpack evolution models such as SnowModel offer users increased flexibility at the expense of added complexity, but can provide critical insights into fine‐scale responses to rapidly changing snow properties.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"","completed":"","followupvalue":"","id":2107,"users":[],"followup":null},{"milestone":210,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"October 2, 2019","shortdate":"10/2/2019","datevalue":"20191002","action":"<p><strong>The following One Health Group/Health &amp; Well-being Collaboration Team Meetings in 2019 contribute&nbsp;to this performance Element.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"/members/events/10557\">Health &amp; Well-being October 16th Meeting</a>&nbsp;</strong><strong>(</strong><a href=\"/members/documents/12266\"><strong>Agenda</strong></a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"/members/documents/12390\"><strong>Notes</strong></a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"http://anthc.adobeconnect.com/pcsrwcyfn18c/\"><strong>Recordings</strong></a><strong>):</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>Topic:&nbsp;</em>One Health Quarterly Meeting</li>\r\n<li><em>Presentations:</em>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Literature Review for Emerging Circumpolar Food Security Topics- Tuula Hollmen, DVM, PhD, Alaska Sealife Center</li>\r\n<li>CDC&nbsp;Zoonosis Prioritization Process- Casey Barton Behravesh DVM, One Health Office</li>\r\n<li>Tick Surveillance Updates- Micah Hahn PhD.

This Inuit-led report illuminates the unique and rich Inuit values and management practices that have successfully safeguarded the Arctic for thousands of years.\n\nWe, Inuit, are at the forefront of the drastic changes taking place in the Arctic. As the world community increasingly turns its focus to the Arctic, it is important to ensure that Inuit Food Sovereignty is a priority in every context. This report links Inuit Food Sovereignty to holistic and adaptive management strategies that can ensure the food security, health, and well-being of Inuit throughout the Arctic for generations to come.\n\nThe legal systems summarized in the report were formed at a time when Indigenous Knowledge and Inuit management approaches were not given the respect and recognition they deserve by western cultures. For thousands of years, we have thrived in the Arctic. Our culture is rooted in values that shape the relationships we hold with everything within the Arctic ecosystem. Our values including respect, collaboration, and sharing all aid in supporting healthy and harmonious relationships and communities. These values are the core of our traditional management practices.\n\n Western management systems overlaid on top of traditional Inuit practices often take a different approach, sometimes grounded in historical discrimination. This report elevates our values, knowledge, and practices to bring forward the roles and perspectives of Inuit to support equity and food sovereignty.\n\n The report uses four case studies focused on walrus, char, beluga, and salmon as a lens to explore current management and co-management practices in Alaska and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region. The report further offers snapshots of important connecting components, such as climate change, the need for an ecosystem-based approach, the impacts of imposed borders, and the strength and resilience of Inuit culture.\n\n Throughout this work, the authors have emphasized the importance of law and policy reforms needed to capture the perspectives of Inuit. In addition, the interpretation and implementation of such law and policy must be understood in relation to how they support or impede our food sovereignty in a rapidly changing Arctic.\n\n All of the dimensions of self-determination related to management and co-management are reflected in the transformative recommendations offered by the contributing authors. These recommendations span across national and international realms. If implemented, the recommendations will support Inuit food sovereignty, holistic and adaptive decision-making, and the well-being of the entire Arctic.\n\nThis project was conducted in partnership with the  Eskimo Walrus Commission, the Inuvialuit Game Council, the Fisheries Joint Management Committee, the Kuskokwim River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, the Association of Village Council Presidents, Environmental Law Institute, and advised by ICC Canada. The report is a product of over 90 Inuit authors and a nine member Advisory Committee.\n\n This report will be of use to a broad spectrum of people. Inuit communities and co-management groups may use the reports to aid in communicating with those from outside their communities. Decision-makers, federal/state/territorial governments, academics, environmentalists, policy-makers, and industry may use the Final Report as a tool to enhance their understanding of the Arctic and to heighten Inuit Food Sovereignty.\n\n This report is accessible on our website at www.iccalaska.org. \n\nThe following link will take you directly to the report &amp;ndash; https://iccalaska.org/media-and-reports/inuit-food-security-project/\n\nThis work is supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1732373.

If implemented, the recommendations will support Inuit food sovereignty, holistic and adaptive decision-making, and the well-being of the entire Arctic.<br /><br />This project was conducted in partnership with the Eskimo Walrus Commission, the Inuvialuit Game Council, the Fisheries Joint Management Committee, the Kuskokwim River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, the Association of Village Council Presidents, Environmental Law Institute, and advised by ICC Canada. The report is a product of over 90 Inuit authors and a nine member Advisory Committee.<br /><br /> This report will be of use to a broad spectrum of people. Inuit communities and co-management groups may use the reports to aid in communicating with those from outside their communities. Decision-makers, federal/state/territorial governments, academics, environmentalists, policy-makers, and industry may use the Final Report as a tool to enhance their understanding of the Arctic and to heighten Inuit Food Sovereignty.<br /><br /> This report is accessible on our website at www.iccalaska.org. <br /><br />The following link will take you directly to the report &ndash; https://iccalaska.org/media-and-reports/inuit-food-security-project/<br /><br />This work is supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1732373.

This Inuit-led report illuminates the unique and rich Inuit values and management practices that have successfully safeguarded the Arctic for thousands of years.\n\nWe, Inuit, are at the forefront of the drastic changes taking place in the Arctic. As the world community increasingly turns its focus to the Arctic, it is important to ensure that Inuit Food Sovereignty is a priority in every context. This report links Inuit Food Sovereignty to holistic and adaptive management strategies that can ensure the food security, health, and well-being of Inuit throughout the Arctic for generations to come.\n\nThe legal systems summarized in the report were formed at a time when Indigenous Knowledge and Inuit management approaches were not given the respect and recognition they deserve by western cultures. For thousands of years, we have thrived in the Arctic. Our culture is rooted in values that shape the relationships we hold with everything within the Arctic ecosystem. Our values including respect, collaboration, and sharing all aid in supporting healthy and harmonious relationships and communities. These values are the core of our traditional management practices.\n\n Western management systems overlaid on top of traditional Inuit practices often take a different approach, sometimes grounded in historical discrimination. This report elevates our values, knowledge, and practices to bring forward the roles and perspectives of Inuit to support equity and food sovereignty.\n\n The report uses four case studies focused on walrus, char, beluga, and salmon as a lens to explore current management and co-management practices in Alaska and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region. The report further offers snapshots of important connecting components, such as climate change, the need for an ecosystem-based approach, the impacts of imposed borders, and the strength and resilience of Inuit culture.\n\n Throughout this work, the authors have emphasized the importance of law and policy reforms needed to capture the perspectives of Inuit. In addition, the interpretation and implementation of such law and policy must be understood in relation to how they support or impede our food sovereignty in a rapidly changing Arctic.\n\n All of the dimensions of self-determination related to management and co-management are reflected in the transformative recommendations offered by the contributing authors. These recommendations span across national and international realms. If implemented, the recommendations will support Inuit food sovereignty, holistic and adaptive decision-making, and the well-being of the entire Arctic.\n\nThis project was conducted in partnership with the  Eskimo Walrus Commission, the Inuvialuit Game Council, the Fisheries Joint Management Committee, the Kuskokwim River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, the Association of Village Council Presidents, Environmental Law Institute, and advised by ICC Canada. The report is a product of over 90 Inuit authors and a nine member Advisory Committee.\n\n This report will be of use to a broad spectrum of people. Inuit communities and co-management groups may use the reports to aid in communicating with those from outside their communities. Decision-makers, federal/state/territorial governments, academics, environmentalists, policy-makers, and industry may use the Final Report as a tool to enhance their understanding of the Arctic and to heighten Inuit Food Sovereignty.\n\n This report is accessible on our website at www.iccalaska.org. \n\nThe following link will take you directly to the report &amp;ndash; https://iccalaska.org/media-and-reports/inuit-food-security-project/\n\nThis work is supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1732373.

This Inuit-led report illuminates the unique and rich Inuit values and management practices that have successfully safeguarded the Arctic for thousands of years.\n\nWe, Inuit, are at the forefront of the drastic changes taking place in the Arctic. As the world community increasingly turns its focus to the Arctic, it is important to ensure that Inuit Food Sovereignty is a priority in every context. This report links Inuit Food Sovereignty to holistic and adaptive management strategies that can ensure the food security, health, and well-being of Inuit throughout the Arctic for generations to come.\n\nThe legal systems summarized in the report were formed at a time when Indigenous Knowledge and Inuit management approaches were not given the respect and recognition they deserve by western cultures. For thousands of years, we have thrived in the Arctic. Our culture is rooted in values that shape the relationships we hold with everything within the Arctic ecosystem. Our values including respect, collaboration, and sharing all aid in supporting healthy and harmonious relationships and communities. These values are the core of our traditional management practices.\n\n Western management systems overlaid on top of traditional Inuit practices often take a different approach, sometimes grounded in historical discrimination. This report elevates our values, knowledge, and practices to bring forward the roles and perspectives of Inuit to support equity and food sovereignty.\n\n The report uses four case studies focused on walrus, char, beluga, and salmon as a lens to explore current management and co-management practices in Alaska and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region. The report further offers snapshots of important connecting components, such as climate change, the need for an ecosystem-based approach, the impacts of imposed borders, and the strength and resilience of Inuit culture.\n\n Throughout this work, the authors have emphasized the importance of law and policy reforms needed to capture the perspectives of Inuit. In addition, the interpretation and implementation of such law and policy must be understood in relation to how they support or impede our food sovereignty in a rapidly changing Arctic.\n\n All of the dimensions of self-determination related to management and co-management are reflected in the transformative recommendations offered by the contributing authors. These recommendations span across national and international realms. If implemented, the recommendations will support Inuit food sovereignty, holistic and adaptive decision-making, and the well-being of the entire Arctic.\n\nThis project was conducted in partnership with the  Eskimo Walrus Commission, the Inuvialuit Game Council, the Fisheries Joint Management Committee, the Kuskokwim River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, the Association of Village Council Presidents, Environmental Law Institute, and advised by ICC Canada. The report is a product of over 90 Inuit authors and a nine member Advisory Committee.\n\n This report will be of use to a broad spectrum of people. Inuit communities and co-management groups may use the reports to aid in communicating with those from outside their communities.

Unlike earlier top-down models of polar animal-climate-people connections that tied changes in Arctic species&rsquo; abundance and ranges to alternating warmer and cooler temperatures or high ice/low sea-ice regimes, rapid animal declines (&lsquo;crashes&rsquo;) may be better approached at regional and local scales. This approach is close to Arctic peoples&rsquo; traditional vision that animals, like people, live in &lsquo;tribes&rsquo; and that they &lsquo;come and go&rsquo; according to their relations with the local human societies. As the Arctic changes rapidly and climate/sea-ice/ ecotone boundaries shift, we see diverse responses by Arctic people and animals to environmental stressors. The article examines recent data on the status of three northern mammal species &ndash; caribou/reindeer, Pacific walrus, and polar bear&mdash;during two decades of the ongoing Arctic warming. The emerging record may be best approached as a series of local human-animal disequilibria interpreted from different angles by population biologists, indigenous peoples, and anthropologists, rather than a top-down climate-induced &lsquo;crash.&rsquo; Such new understanding implies the varying speed of change in the physical, animal, and human domains,which was not factored in the earlier models of climate&ndash;animal&ndash;people&rsquo;s interactions.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"9/30/2018","completed":"September 30, 2018","followupvalue":"20180930","id":1857,"users":[{"id":94,"name":"Igor Krupnik","link":"/members/people/101"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","September 30, 2018"]}},{"milestone":273,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"October 16, 2018","shortdate":"10/16/2018","datevalue":"20181016","action":"<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) has recently awarded OPP &ndash; 1836473.

This\\nlifestyle has attributed to historically low rates of diet related diseases, which are increasing\\nwith the transition to westernized customs. Our OVERALL OBJECTIVE is to create a unique\\nculturally appropriatetiered approach to engage rural AN students in science-based\\ndiscovery, highlighting the health benefits of their traditional subsistence lifestyle and\\npromoting their transition to higher education and lifelong community engagement.\\nSpecifically we aim to: a)Engage with rural communities that are inaccessible by road via a\\nprecollege mobile riverboat laboratory to investigate issues pertaining to local food security,\\ncommunity health disparities, and traditional activities that can be integrated into local\\nscience curricula and showcased at the Alaska Statewide High School Science Symposium.\\nb)Support continued community engagement and more intensive bioexploration on\\nsubsistence health and Arctic resilience by providing universityscholarships to promising\\nrural high school researchers who will then act as research mentor for the next round of rural\\nstudents--'back to t he river'.c)Smooth the transition and integration of AN students in\\nuniversity life by working with existing initiatives to strengthen academic/research advisories,\\nfood storage/sharing resources, and organized traditional activities that celebrate\\nsubsistence foods and their positive health impacts.

These values are the core of our traditional management practices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Western management systems overlaid on top of traditional Inuit practices often take a different approach, sometimes grounded in historical discrimination. This report elevates our values, knowledge, and practices to bring forward the roles and perspectives of Inuit to support equity and food sovereignty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The report uses four case studies focused on walrus, char, beluga, and salmon as a lens to explore current management and co-management practices in Alaska and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region. The report further offers snapshots of important connecting components, such as climate change, the need for an ecosystem-based approach, the impacts of imposed borders, and the strength and resilience of Inuit culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Throughout this work, the authors have emphasized the importance of law and policy reforms needed to capture the perspectives of Inuit. In addition, the interpretation and implementation of such law and policy must be understood in relation to how they support or impede our food sovereignty in a rapidly changing Arctic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; All of the dimensions of self-determination related to management and co-management are reflected in the transformative recommendations offered by the contributing authors. These recommendations span across national and international realms. If implemented, the recommendations will support Inuit food sovereignty, holistic and adaptive decision-making, and the well-being of the entire Arctic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This project was conducted in partnership with the Eskimo Walrus Commission, the Inuvialuit Game Council, the Fisheries Joint Management Committee, the Kuskokwim River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, the Association of Village Council Presidents, Environmental Law Institute, and advised by ICC Canada.

The project will (1) survey and excavate an early archaeological located just south of the ice-free corridor to develop a predictive model of early colonization of the region; (2) integrate Native American oral history into archaeological research related to the peopling of North America; (3) train tribal members in the study and management of their cultural heritage; (4) translate scientific findings for Native American groups; and (5) develop school curricula for the benefit of Blackfoot, Alaskan, and other Native communities.

The project will employ a mixed methods research strategy collecting and assembling text and video documentation of historical ceremonial practice, and contemporary performances. The project will focus on traditional hunting ceremonies because these are most at risk within the current social and cultural system. The project will focus on analyzing the documentary record in consultation with Indigenous scholars, and key texts will be chosen for transcription in the native language and translation to western languages to create a corpus of digital data. Qualitative content analysis of these native texts, cultural domain analysis, and Indigenous commentary will be used to develop an understanding of cultural principles and practices that support community health and well-being and a sustainable relationship to the environment. The data management plan for the project is extensive and includes an online, open-ended, multi-media archive accessible to other scholars and the public. The data will be collected and stored using a Drupal-based platform for a Mukurtu-like Collection Management System; this is a free, mobile, and open source platform built with Indigenous communities to manage and share digital cultural heritage. The data will also be stored with the Exchange of Local Observations and Knowledge of the Arctic (ELOKA) at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).

This Inuit-led report illuminates the unique and rich Inuit values and management practices that have successfully safeguarded the Arctic for thousands of years.\n\nWe, Inuit, are at the forefront of the drastic changes taking place in the Arctic. As the world community increasingly turns its focus to the Arctic, it is important to ensure that Inuit Food Sovereignty is a priority in every context. This report links Inuit Food Sovereignty to holistic and adaptive management strategies that can ensure the food security, health, and well-being of Inuit throughout the Arctic for generations to come.\n\nThe legal systems summarized in the report were formed at a time when Indigenous Knowledge and Inuit management approaches were not given the respect and recognition they deserve by western cultures. For thousands of years, we have thrived in the Arctic. Our culture is rooted in values that shape the relationships we hold with everything within the Arctic ecosystem. Our values including respect, collaboration, and sharing all aid in supporting healthy and harmonious relationships and communities. These values are the core of our traditional management practices.\n\n Western management systems overlaid on top of traditional Inuit practices often take a different approach, sometimes grounded in historical discrimination. This report elevates our values, knowledge, and practices to bring forward the roles and perspectives of Inuit to support equity and food sovereignty.\n\n The report uses four case studies focused on walrus, char, beluga, and salmon as a lens to explore current management and co-management practices in Alaska and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region. The report further offers snapshots of important connecting components, such as climate change, the need for an ecosystem-based approach, the impacts of imposed borders, and the strength and resilience of Inuit culture.\n\n Throughout this work, the authors have emphasized the importance of law and policy reforms needed to capture the perspectives of Inuit. In addition, the interpretation and implementation of such law and policy must be understood in relation to how they support or impede our food sovereignty in a rapidly changing Arctic.\n\n All of the dimensions of self-determination related to management and co-management are reflected in the transformative recommendations offered by the contributing authors. These recommendations span across national and international realms. If implemented, the recommendations will support Inuit food sovereignty, holistic and adaptive decision-making, and the well-being of the entire Arctic.\n\nThis project was conducted in partnership with the  Eskimo Walrus Commission, the Inuvialuit Game Council, the Fisheries Joint Management Committee, the Kuskokwim River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, the Association of Village Council Presidents, Environmental Law Institute, and advised by ICC Canada. The report is a product of over 90 Inuit authors and a nine member Advisory Committee.\n\n This report will be of use to a broad spectrum of people. Inuit communities and co-management groups may use the reports to aid in communicating with those from outside their communities. Decision-makers, federal/state/territorial governments, academics, environmentalists, policy-makers, and industry may use the Final Report as a tool to enhance their understanding of the Arctic and to heighten Inuit Food Sovereignty.\n\n This report is accessible on our website at www.iccalaska.org. \n\nThe following link will take you directly to the report &amp;ndash; https://iccalaska.org/media-and-reports/inuit-food-security-project/\n\nThis work is supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1732373.

This Inuit-led report illuminates the unique and rich Inuit values and management practices that have successfully safeguarded the Arctic for thousands of years.<br><br>We, Inuit, are at the forefront of the drastic changes taking place in the Arctic. As the world community increasingly turns its focus to the Arctic, it is important to ensure that Inuit Food Sovereignty is a priority in every context. This report links Inuit Food Sovereignty to holistic and adaptive management strategies that can ensure the food security, health, and well-being of Inuit throughout the Arctic for generations to come.<br><br>The legal systems summarized in the report were formed at a time when Indigenous Knowledge and Inuit management approaches were not given the respect and recognition they deserve by western cultures. For thousands of years, we have thrived in the Arctic. Our culture is rooted in values that shape the relationships we hold with everything within the Arctic ecosystem. Our values including respect, collaboration, and sharing all aid in supporting healthy and harmonious relationships and communities. These values are the core of our traditional management practices.<br><br> Western management systems overlaid on top of traditional Inuit practices often take a different approach, sometimes grounded in historical discrimination. This report elevates our values, knowledge, and practices to bring forward the roles and perspectives of Inuit to support equity and food sovereignty.<br><br> The report uses four case studies focused on walrus, char, beluga, and salmon as a lens to explore current management and co-management practices in Alaska and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region. The report further offers snapshots of important connecting components, such as climate change, the need for an ecosystem-based approach, the impacts of imposed borders, and the strength and resilience of Inuit culture.<br><br> Throughout this work, the authors have emphasized the importance of law and policy reforms needed to capture the perspectives of Inuit. In addition, the interpretation and implementation of such law and policy must be understood in relation to how they support or impede our food sovereignty in a rapidly changing Arctic.<br><br> All of the dimensions of self-determination related to management and co-management are reflected in the transformative recommendations offered by the contributing authors.

Specifically, the investigators will study experiences that both elders and youth face and how they make sense of their past as well as the contemporary shifts in rural lives and livelihoods. Issues of language, tradition, and kinship ties are crucial facets for exploring such dynamics. The researchers will incorporate methods of participant observation, community-based focus groups and individual interviews to capture the central issues and comparative understandings relating to subsistence and out-migration in each of the four communities that are the focus of the study. The research will result in a broad in-depth understanding of issues facing rural Alaska Natives today from their own perspectives. The collaboration between elders and youth will contribute to community discussions on the social, cultural, political and economic issues that each ethnic and ecological area faces, highlighting both the convergences and divergences of policies and practices at the local level.</p><p></p>

Transportation infrastructure plays a crucial role in economic development by enhancing connectivity between places. In many remote Arctic regions, formal roads are rare, and transportation infrastructure consists predominantly of trails and paths established by Indigenous people for subsistence purposes as well as temporary roads laid out for resource exploration. This project is a detailed interdisciplinary analysis of the overall impact of informal transportation routes on the Arctic socioecological system. The expected project results will contribute to planning for sustainable development of Arctic and Subarctic regions, which are experiencing unprecedented anthropogenic and climate-induced changes.

The relationship between the prehistoric inhabitants of the Rat Islands, the Unangan, and birds was maintained by a suite of continual and often daily practices, from hunting, to storytelling, to subsistence. The resulting artifacts of these day-to-day activities, play a significant role in the reproduction of social and cultural values.

In Alaska, solutions to repetitive flooding for Inupiat and other Indigenous communities in the Arctic have not been forthcoming, despite experiencing repetitive flooding events. Additionally, there is some indication that policy options for relocation are more challenging when decision-making occurs at the community level, as it often does in Indigenous communities, instead of at the household level. This project addresses two lines of inquiry into this complex problem. First, investigators will analyze relocation policy options for communities experiencing repetitive flooding. The second line of inquiry is to examine what constitutes culturally relevant relocation from an Inupiat perspective.

Statistics about well-being, morbidity, and mortality of Alaska Natives have been collected by the State of Alaska and federal agencies that manage fish and wildlife, but the collected data are often limited in their definition of well-being to state and federal specifications. Expanding upon fourteen months of ethnographic research in an Alaska Native (Yupiaq) village in rural southwest Alaska, this project explores these definitions further and focuses on how salmon are central to Yupiaq peoples' understandings and experiences of well-being. This research analyzes how resource management policy can affect the well-being of Yupiaq peoples and how the management of fisheries in the State of Alaska is related to Yupiaq food security and health.

Integration is widely discussed in the context of immigration, yet there have been few studies that explore precisely what integration means to both immigrants and the long-term, native residents. Even less studied is what integration means within rural communities, since immigration rates to these communities typically are not large enough to constitute sites that would be generalizable. In exploring a context where small, rural communities experience relatively high rates of immigration, this research examines the activities and services that both natives and immigrants incorporate into their communities for integration and analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of those strategies. Data about how both native residents and immigrants identify integration and the best methods to achieve it will advance anthropological science and assist policymakers, social service agencies, and other groups dealing with the effects of immigration into rural areas at local, national, and international levels.

The research project seeks to better understand the consequences of complex processes from the perspective of Alaska Native people across generations in two different regions of Alaska, the Yup'ik of the Yukon-Kuskowkim Delta and the Gwich'in of the Yukon Flats. Specifically, the investigators will study experiences that both elders and youth face and how they make sense of their past as well as the contemporary shifts in rural lives and livelihoods. Issues of language, tradition, and kinship ties are crucial facets for exploring such dynamics. The researchers will incorporate methods of participant observation, community-based focus groups and individual interviews to capture the central issues and comparative understandings relating to subsistence and out-migration in each of the four communities that are the focus of the study. The research will result in a broad in-depth understanding of issues facing rural Alaska Natives today from their own perspectives.

This Inuit-led report illuminates the unique and rich Inuit values and management practices that have successfully safeguarded the Arctic for thousands of years.\n\nWe, Inuit, are at the forefront of the drastic changes taking place in the Arctic. As the world community increasingly turns its focus to the Arctic, it is important to ensure that Inuit Food Sovereignty is a priority in every context. This report links Inuit Food Sovereignty to holistic and adaptive management strategies that can ensure the food security, health, and well-being of Inuit throughout the Arctic for generations to come.\n\nThe legal systems summarized in the report were formed at a time when Indigenous Knowledge and Inuit management approaches were not given the respect and recognition they deserve by western cultures. For thousands of years, we have thrived in the Arctic. Our culture is rooted in values that shape the relationships we hold with everything within the Arctic ecosystem. Our values including respect, collaboration, and sharing all aid in supporting healthy and harmonious relationships and communities. These values are the core of our traditional management practices.\n\n Western management systems overlaid on top of traditional Inuit practices often take a different approach, sometimes grounded in historical discrimination. This report elevates our values, knowledge, and practices to bring forward the roles and perspectives of Inuit to support equity and food sovereignty.\n\n The report uses four case studies focused on walrus, char, beluga, and salmon as a lens to explore current management and co-management practices in Alaska and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region. The report further offers snapshots of important connecting components, such as climate change, the need for an ecosystem-based approach, the impacts of imposed borders, and the strength and resilience of Inuit culture.\n\n Throughout this work, the authors have emphasized the importance of law and policy reforms needed to capture the perspectives of Inuit. In addition, the interpretation and implementation of such law and policy must be understood in relation to how they support or impede our food sovereignty in a rapidly changing Arctic.\n\n All of the dimensions of self-determination related to management and co-management are reflected in the transformative recommendations offered by the contributing authors. These recommendations span across national and international realms. If implemented, the recommendations will support Inuit food sovereignty, holistic and adaptive decision-making, and the well-being of the entire Arctic.\n\nThis project was conducted in partnership with the  Eskimo Walrus Commission, the Inuvialuit Game Council, the Fisheries Joint Management Committee, the Kuskokwim River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, the Association of Village Council Presidents, Environmental Law Institute, and advised by ICC Canada. The report is a product of over 90 Inuit authors and a nine member Advisory Committee.\n\n This report will be of use to a broad spectrum of people. Inuit communities and co-management groups may use the reports to aid in communicating with those from outside their communities. Decision-makers, federal/state/territorial governments, academics, environmentalists, policy-makers, and industry may use the Final Report as a tool to enhance their understanding of the Arctic and to heighten Inuit Food Sovereignty.\n\n This report is accessible on our website at www.iccalaska.org. \n\nThe following link will take you directly to the report &amp;ndash; https://iccalaska.org/media-and-reports/inuit-food-security-project/\n\nThis work is supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1732373.

Employing a participatory framework that prioritizes knowledge co-production, this project will provide a baseline assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on subsistence practices, traditional food knowledge, and food access. Improved understanding of the obstacles to food security and the resiliencies in Indigenous foodways will enable both communities and policy makers to plan proactively for future adverse events. Enhanced preparedness will directly benefit Indigenous communities in Alaska and the Southwest U.S. and contribute more generally to advancing national health and welfare.</p><p></p>

Specifically, the international community has developed a joint vision for a connected, collaborative, and comprehensive long-term pan-Arctic Observing System that serves societal needs. The project transforms the Arctic Observing Summit (AOS) from a biennial meeting into an ongoing process and resource to aid with coordination of observations. Food security, in particular for Alaska coastal communities but also in the context of large-scale fisheries and other factors of national concern has been substantially impacted by changing ice and ocean conditions that have been most pronounced in the Pacific Arctic sector in recent years. The project draws on different assessment, modeling, and observing system design approaches to lay the foundation for a food-security oriented information product integrating different types of coordinated observations.

This project is centered on conceptualizing Indigenous Knowledge to better understand historical and contemporary ways in which Alaska Native people steward salmon, the cultural contexts connected to salmon stewardship, and Indigenous approaches to current management practices and systems. Indigenous people have served as stewards of Alaska lands and waters for thousands of years yet have been largely excluded from science and management systems.

Unfortunately, many of the laws and policies at issue demand contrary\nactions or work at cross-purposes, making management that is consistent with these laws\nvery difficult. Coherent, comprehensive, long-term management is the goal of federal and\nstate resource management agencies. Yet incompatibilities occur all too often, thwarting the\ngoal of comprehensive management.Conflicting laws or management goals governing the\nsame set of resources or adjacent resources affect the ability of resource managers to carry\nout their intended statutory mandates. If agencies are forced to work at cross purposes,\neach canceling out the actions of the other, or if laws mandate mutually exclusive goals on\nthe same area of land, then the functionality of the resource management system is\ncompromised. Such conflict can be identified in many of the land, resource, and wildlife\nmanagement laws in existence today. For example, in his book Haycox describes the\noppositional thinking in Alaska that often results in state goals that actively resist federal\nrules, even on federal lands. Similar state/federal conflict occurs in many other western\nstates as well.The first purpose of this work will be to identify situations in which laws or\npolicies with conflicting purposes or methodologies exist, to analyze that legal conflict in\norder to understand how it manifested and what its practical consequences are, and when\npossible to recommend changes or revised interpretations that avoid or eliminate the\nconflict. The analyses and suggestions that result from this work, by explaining how legal\ncontradictions can be understood and, in particular circumstances, resolved, will benefit land\nmanagers and resource professionals in the pursuit of their assigned goals. Additionally, this\nwork will help the public better understand their rights and responsibilities, and the legal\nlimitations guiding the various agencies tasked with managing lands and resources. By\nexpanding the available literature and providing comprehensive materials on certain key\nissues, the knowledge base available to the legal community will also be augmented. Finally,\nlegislators and regulators who strive to avoid or ameliorate such conflicts may also find this\nwork useful.In addition, with the advent of climate change new areas of conflict, between\nolder laws and newer realities, have begun to emerge (Camacho, 2009; Angelo, 2006;\nFlournoy, 1996).

If agencies are forced to work at cross purposes,\\neach canceling out the actions of the other, or if laws mandate mutually exclusive goals on\\nthe same area of land, then the functionality of the resource management system is\\ncompromised. Such conflict can be identified in many of the land, resource, and wildlife\\nmanagement laws in existence today.

Similar state/federal conflict occurs in many other western\\nstates as well.The first purpose of this work will be to identify situations in which laws or\\npolicies with conflicting purposes or methodologies exist, to analyze that legal conflict in\\norder to understand how it manifested and what its practical consequences are, and when\\npossible to recommend changes or revised interpretations that avoid or eliminate the\\nconflict. The analyses and suggestions that result from this work, by explaining how legal\\ncontradictions can be understood and, in particular circumstances, resolved, will benefit land\\nmanagers and resource professionals in the pursuit of their assigned goals. Additionally, this\\nwork will help the public better understand their rights and responsibilities, and the legal\\nlimitations guiding the various agencies tasked with managing lands and resources. By\\nexpanding the available literature and providing comprehensive materials on certain key\\nissues, the knowledge base available to the legal community will also be augmented. Finally,\\nlegislators and regulators who strive to avoid or ameliorate such conflicts may also find this\\nwork useful.In addition, with the advent of climate change new areas of conflict, between\\nolder laws and newer realities, have begun to emerge (Camacho, 2009; Angelo, 2006;\\nFlournoy, 1996).

Every year, project analysts check to see whether any of the children have been reported to child welfare or receive services from other public programs. As the children get older, they are able to calculate the percentage of children in each age group who have ever been involved with child welfare during their lifetime (&amp;ldquo;cumulative incidence&amp;rdquo;).
