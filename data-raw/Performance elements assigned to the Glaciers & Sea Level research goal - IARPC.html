&lt;p&gt;GRACE-FO continues to track monthly mass changes to important cryosphere, hydrologic,and ecosystem targets, providing insights into ice loss in Greenland, Antarcticand mountain glaciers, changes in the global water cycle, and the dynamics ofterrestrial hydrology associated with permafrost and seasonal snow waterchanges. As of July-2020, GRACE-FO has provided 24 global monthly mass changemaps, adding two additional years to the 15-year global mass change data recordfrom GRACE (2002-2017). The GRACE-FO Science Data System team determined thatno biases exist between the GRACE and GRACE‐FO records and that the level of measurementsystem performance is allowing GRACE‐FO to meet its goal of extending theoriginal GRACE record at an equivalent precision and spatiotemporal sampling. Through early2019, GRACE-FO detected reduced mass loss on the Greenland ice sheet,consistent with observations from NASA&amp;rsquo;s Oceans Melting Greenlandinvestigation. However, this was followed by a record-breaking 2019 summer meltseason, with the Greenland ice sheet losing 223 &amp;plusmn; 12 Gt/month during the monthof July alone, and a record annual mass loss of 532 &amp;plusmn; 58 Gt/yr (Sasgen et al.,2020; Velicogna et al., 2019). Seven of the glacial regions (outside ofGreenland and Antarctica) that dominate global ice mass losses are melting atan accelerated rate: Alaska, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, the SouthernAndes, High Mountain Asia, the Russian Arctic, Iceland and the Norwegianarchipelago Svalbard, with the five Arctic regions accounting for the greatestshare of ice loss (Cirac&amp;igrave; et al., 2020). Landerer, F. W.,Flechtner, F. M., Save, H., Webb, F. H., Bandikova, T., Bertiger, W. I., et al.(2020). Extending the global masschange data record: GRACE Follow-On instrument and science data performance.Geophysical Research Letters, 47, e2020GL088306. https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL088306AbstractSince June, 2018, the Gravity Recovery and Climate ExperimentFollow‐On (GRACE‐FO) is extending the 15‐year monthly mass change record of the GRACE mission, whichended in June 2017. The GRACE‐FO instrument and flight system performancehas improved over GRACE. Better attitude solutions and enhanced pointing performance result in reduced fuel consumption and gravity range rate post‐fit residuals. One accelerometer requires additionalcalibrations due to unexpected measurement noise. The GRACE‐FO gravity and mass change fields from June 2018 throughDecember 2019 continue the GRACE record at an equivalent precision andspatiotemporal sampling. During this period, GRACE‐FO observed large interannual terrestrial water variationsassociated with excess rainfall (Central US, Middle East), drought (Europe,Australia), and ice melt (Greenland). These observations are consistent withindependent mass change estimates, providing high confidence that nointermission biases exist from GRACE to GRACE‐FO, despite the 11‐month gap. GRACE‐FO has also successfully demonstratedsatellite‐to‐satellite laser ranging interferometry. Sasgen I., Wouters,B., Gardner, A.S., King, M.D., Tedesco, M., Landerer, F.W., Dahle, C., Save,H., Fettweis, X. (2020), Return to rapid ice loss in Greenland and record lossin 2019 1 detected by the GRACE-FO satellites, Nature Communications Earth&amp;amp; Environment. https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-020-0010-1AbstractBetween 2003-2016, theGreenland ice sheet (GrIS) was one of the largest contributors to sealevel rise, as it lost about 255 Gt of ice per year. This mass loss slowed in2017 and 2018 to about 100 Gt yr&amp;minus;1. Herewe examine further changes in rate of GrIS mass loss, by analyzing data fromthe GRACE-FO (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment &amp;ndash; Follow On) satellitemission, launched in May 2018. Using simulations with regional climate modelswe show that the mass losses observed in 2017 and 2018 by the GRACE andGRACE-FO missions are lower than in any other two year period between 2003 and2019, the combined period of the two missions. We find that this reduced iceloss results from two anomalous cold summers in western Greenland, compoundedby snow-rich autumn and winter conditions in the east. For 2019, GRACE-FOreveals a return to high melt rates leading to a mass loss of 223&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;12 Gt month&amp;minus;1 duringthe month of July alone, and a record annual mass loss of 532&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;58 Gt yr&amp;minus;1.

For both ice sheets, we find consistent GRACE/GRACE‐FOtime series across the data gap, at the continental and regional scales, andthe data gap is confidently filled with mass budget method data. In Greenland,the GRACE‐FO data reveal an exceptional summer loss of 600 Gt in 2019following two cold summers. In Antarctica, ongoing high mass losses in theAmundsen Sea Embayment of West Antarctica, the Antarctic Peninsula, and WilkesLand in East Antarctica cumulate to 2130, 560, and 370 Gt, respectively,since 2002. A cumulative mass gain of 980 Gt in Queen Maud Land since2009, however, led to a pause in the acceleration in mass loss from Antarcticaafter 2016.

Seven regions dominate themass loss, with the largest share from the Arctic: Alaska(72.5 &amp;plusmn; 8 Gt/yr), Canadian Arctic Archipelago(73.0 &amp;plusmn; 9 Gt/yr), Southern Andes (30.4 &amp;plusmn; 13 Gt/yr),High Mountain Asia (HMA) (28.8 &amp;plusmn; 11 Gt/yr), Russian Arctic(20.2 &amp;plusmn; 6 Gt/yr), Iceland (15.9 &amp;plusmn; 4 Gt/yr), andSvalbard (12.1 &amp;plusmn; 4 Gt/yr).

<p>GRACE-FO continues to track monthly mass changes to important cryosphere, hydrologic,and ecosystem targets, providing insights into ice loss in Greenland, Antarcticand mountain glaciers, changes in the global water cycle, and the dynamics ofterrestrial hydrology associated with permafrost and seasonal snow waterchanges. As of July-2020, GRACE-FO has provided 24 global monthly mass changemaps, adding two additional years to the 15-year global mass change data recordfrom GRACE (2002-2017). The GRACE-FO Science Data System team determined thatno biases exist between the GRACE and GRACE‐FO records and that the level of measurementsystem performance is allowing GRACE‐FO to meet its goal of extending theoriginal GRACE record at an equivalent precision and spatiotemporal sampling. Through early2019, GRACE-FO detected reduced mass loss on the Greenland ice sheet,consistent with observations from NASA’s Oceans Melting Greenlandinvestigation. However, this was followed by a record-breaking 2019 summer meltseason, with the Greenland ice sheet losing 223 ± 12 Gt/month during the monthof July alone, and a record annual mass loss of 532 ± 58 Gt/yr (Sasgen et al.,2020; Velicogna et al., 2019). Seven of the glacial regions (outside ofGreenland and Antarctica) that dominate global ice mass losses are melting atan accelerated rate: Alaska, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, the SouthernAndes, High Mountain Asia, the Russian Arctic, Iceland and the Norwegianarchipelago Svalbard, with the five Arctic regions accounting for the greatestshare of ice loss (Ciracì et al., 2020). Landerer, F. W.,Flechtner, F. M., Save, H., Webb, F. H., Bandikova, T., Bertiger, W. I., et al.(2020). Extending the global masschange data record: GRACE Follow-On instrument and science data performance.Geophysical Research Letters, 47, e2020GL088306. https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL088306AbstractSince June, 2018, the Gravity Recovery and Climate ExperimentFollow‐On (GRACE‐FO) is extending the 15‐year monthly mass change record of the GRACE mission, whichended in June 2017. The GRACE‐FO instrument and flight system performancehas improved over GRACE. Better attitude solutions and enhanced pointing performance result in reduced fuel consumption and gravity range rate post‐fit residuals. One accelerometer requires additionalcalibrations due to unexpected measurement noise. The GRACE‐FO gravity and mass change fields from June 2018 throughDecember 2019 continue the GRACE record at an equivalent precision andspatiotemporal sampling. During this period, GRACE‐FO observed large interannual terrestrial water variationsassociated with excess rainfall (Central US, Middle East), drought (Europe,Australia), and ice melt (Greenland). These observations are consistent withindependent mass change estimates, providing high confidence that nointermission biases exist from GRACE to GRACE‐FO, despite the 11‐month gap. GRACE‐FO has also successfully demonstratedsatellite‐to‐satellite laser ranging interferometry.

(2020), Return to rapid ice loss in Greenland and record lossin 2019 1 detected by the GRACE-FO satellites, Nature Communications Earth&amp; Environment. https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-020-0010-1AbstractBetween 2003-2016, theGreenland ice sheet (GrIS) was one of the largest contributors to sealevel rise, as it lost about 255 Gt of ice per year. This mass loss slowed in2017 and 2018 to about 100 Gt yr−1. Herewe examine further changes in rate of GrIS mass loss, by analyzing data fromthe GRACE-FO (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment – Follow On) satellitemission, launched in May 2018. Using simulations with regional climate modelswe show that the mass losses observed in 2017 and 2018 by the GRACE andGRACE-FO missions are lower than in any other two year period between 2003 and2019, the combined period of the two missions. We find that this reduced iceloss results from two anomalous cold summers in western Greenland, compoundedby snow-rich autumn and winter conditions in the east.

Lett. 13 (2018) 105005, doi:10.1088/1748-9326/aae3ec. Abstract: Large-scale changes in Arctic sea ice thickness, volume and multiyear sea ice (MYI) coverage with available measurements from submarine sonars, satellite altimeters (&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-125&quot;&gt;ICESat&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;and CryoSat-2), and satellite scatterometers are summarized. The submarine record spans the period between 1958 and 2000, the satellite altimeter records between 2003 and 2018, and the scatterometer records between 1999 and 2017. Regional changes in ice thickness (since 1958) and within the data release area of the Arctic Ocean, previously reported by Kwok and Rothrock (2009 Geophys. Res. Lett. 36 L15501), have been updated to include the 8 years of CryoSat-2 (CS-2) retrievals. Between the pre-1990 submarine period (1958&amp;ndash;1976) and the CS-2 period (2011&amp;ndash;2018) the average thickness near the end of the melt season, in six regions, decreased by 2.0mor some 66% over six decades. Within the data release area (~38% of the Arctic Ocean) of submarine ice draft, the thinning of ~1.75min winter since 1980 (maximum thickness of 3.64min the regression analysis) has not changed significantly; the mean thickness over the CS-2 period is&amp;sim;2m. The 15 year satellite record depicts losses in sea ice volume at 2870km3/decade and 5130km3/decade in winter (February&amp;ndash;March) and fall (October&amp;ndash;November), respectively: more moderate trends compared to the sharp decreases over the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-125&quot;&gt;ICESat&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;period, where the losses were weighted by record-setting melt in 2007. Over the scatterometer record (1999&amp;ndash;2017), the Arctic has lost more than 2&amp;Aring;~106km2 of MYI&amp;mdash;a decrease of more than 50%; MYI now covers less than one-third of the Arctic Ocean. Independent MYI coverage and volume records co-vary in time, the MYI area anomalies explain&amp;sim;85% of the variance in the anomalies in Arctic sea ice volume. If losses of MYI continue, Arctic thickness/volume will be controlled by seasonal ice, suggesting that the thickness/volume trends will be more moderate (as seen here) but more sensitive to climate forcing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boisvert, L. N., Webster, M. A., Petty, A. A., Markus, T., Bromwich, D. H., &amp;amp; Cullather, R. I. (2018). Intercomparison of precipitation estimates over the Arctic Ocean and its peripheral seas from reanalyses. Journal of Climate, 31(20), 8441-8462. https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-18-0125.1Abstract: Precipitation over the Arctic Ocean has a significant impact on the basin-scale freshwater and energy budgets but is one of the most poorly constrained variables in atmospheric reanalyses. Precipitation controls the snow cover on sea ice, which impedes the exchange of energy between the ocean and atmosphere, inhibiting sea ice growth. Thus, accurate precipitation amounts are needed to inform sea ice modeling, especially for the production of thickness estimates from satellite altimetry freeboard data. However, obtaining a quantitative estimate of the precipitation distribution in the Arctic is notoriously difficult because of a number of factors, including a lack of reliable, long-term in situ observations; difficulties in remote sensing over sea ice; and model biases in temperature and moisture fields and associated uncertainty of modeled cloud microphysical processes in the polar regions. Here, we compare precipitation estimates over the Arctic Ocean from eight widely used atmospheric reanalyses over the period 2000&amp;ndash;16 (nominally the &amp;ldquo;new Arctic&amp;rdquo;). We find that the magnitude, frequency, and phase of precipitation vary drastically, although interannual variability is similar. Reanalysis-derived precipitation does not increase with time as expected; however, an increasing trend of higher fractions of liquid precipitation (rainfall) is found. When compared with drifting ice mass balance buoys, three reanalyses (ERA-Interim,&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-360&quot;&gt;MERRA&lt;/abbr&gt;, and&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-381&quot;&gt;NCEP&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;R2) produce realistic magnitudes and temporal agreement with observed precipitation events, while two products [&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-360&quot;&gt;MERRA&lt;/abbr&gt;, version 2 (&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-360&quot;&gt;MERRA&lt;/abbr&gt;-2), and CFSR] show large, implausible magnitudes in precipitation events. All the reanalyses tend to produce overly frequent Arctic precipitation. Future work needs to be undertaken to determine the specific factors in reanalyses that contribute to these discrepancies in the new Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Aug 28, 2019&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;released a feature entitled, Landsat Illustrates Five Decades of Change to Greenland Glaciers at https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/landsat-illustrates-five-decades-of-change-to-greenland-glaciers.Ice fronts have retreated, rocky peaks are more exposed, fewer icebergs drift to the ocean: the branching network of glaciers that empty into Greenland&amp;rsquo;s Sermilik Fjord has changed significantly in the last half century. Comparing Landsat images from 1972 and 2019, those changes and more come into view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glaciers appear brownish grey in this true-color Landsat 8 satellite image from Aug. 12, 2019. The color indicates that the surface has melted, a process that concentrates dust and rock particles and leads to a darker recrystallized ice sheet surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The darker melt surface in 2019 extends much farther onto the ice sheet than it did in 1972, when the first Landsat satellite gathered data on the area, said Christopher Shuman, a glaciologist with the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, at&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Landsat is a joint mission of&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;and the U.S. Geological Survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helheim Glacier, one of the largest and fastest flowing of its kind in Greenland, has retreated approximately 4.7 miles (7.5 kilometers) up a wide fjord in the time between the two scenes, leaving a jumble of sea ice where its calving front used to be. To the east, Midgard Glacier has retreated approximately 10 miles (16 kilometers), splitting into two branches farther up the fjord. Changes to the rocky outcrops of the area&amp;rsquo;s mountains and smaller tributary glaciers are also visible by comparing the two Landsat images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot more bare rock visible now, which used to be covered with ice,&amp;rdquo; Shuman said. &amp;ldquo;And all these little glaciers are all getting slammed, as well as the bigger ones like Helheim, Fenris and Midgard. There are scores of examples of change just in this one area.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a close-up of the Helheim Glacier, a patch of open water is visible right at the calving front. Three days after Landsat 8 collected the image over Helheim and its neighboring glaciers,&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;&amp;rsquo;s Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) project flew over that open patch of water in an airplane and dropped a temperature-measuring probe that detected warm water at the ice front. OMG is examining how oceans melt glaciers from below, even as air temperatures warm the ice from above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unusually warm air temperatures this summer have caused record melt across Greenland. Approximately 90% of the surface of Greenland&amp;rsquo;s ice sheet melted at some point between July 30 and Aug. 2, during which time an estimated 55 billion tons of ice melted into the ocean, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Shuman also tracked the unusual warm weather at the top of the Greenland Ice Sheet, 10,550 feet (3,216 meters) above sea level, where temperatures were above freezing for more than 16.5 hours total during July 30 and 31.ATTACHED PHOTOSCaption 1: Glaciers in southeastern Greenland including, from left, Helheim, Fenris and Midgard are seen in a Landsat 8 image from Aug. 12, 2019 (right image), and a composite image from Landsat 1 scenes collected in September 1972 (left image). Comparing images across the span of the Landsat mission provides a record of almost five decades of change to this region of southeast Greenland.Credits:&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;/Christopher Shuman&lt;/p&gt;

One of the largest glaciers in Greenland, Helheim has retreated approximately 4.7 miles (7.5 kilometers) between when these Landsat scenes were collected in 1972 (left image) and 2019 (right image).

<p>“There’s a lot more bare rock visible now, which used to be covered with ice,” Shuman said. “And all these little glaciers are all getting slammed, as well as the bigger ones like Helheim, Fenris and Midgard. There are scores of examples of change just in this one area.”</p>
<p>In a close-up of the Helheim Glacier, a patch of open water is visible right at the calving front. Three days after Landsat 8 collected the image over Helheim and its neighboring glaciers,<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-155">NASA</abbr>’s Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) project flew over that open patch of water in an airplane and dropped a temperature-measuring probe that detected warm water at the ice front. OMG is examining how oceans melt glaciers from below, even as air temperatures warm the ice from above.</p>
<p>Unusually warm air temperatures this summer have caused record melt across Greenland. Approximately 90% of the surface of Greenland’s ice sheet melted at some point between July 30 and Aug. 2, during which time an estimated 55 billion tons of ice melted into the ocean, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Shuman also tracked the unusual warm weather at the top of the Greenland Ice Sheet, 10,550 feet (3,216 meters) above sea level, where temperatures were above freezing for more than 16.5 hours total during July 30 and 31.ATTACHED PHOTOSCaption 1: Glaciers in southeastern Greenland including, from left, Helheim, Fenris and Midgard are seen in a Landsat 8 image from Aug. 12, 2019 (right image), and a composite image from Landsat 1 scenes collected in September 1972 (left image). Comparing images across the span of the Landsat mission provides a record of almost five decades of change to this region of southeast Greenland.Credits:<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-155">NASA</abbr>/Christopher Shuman</p>
<p>Caption 2: The Helheim Glacier is seen in a close-up of the images above. One of the largest glaciers in Greenland, Helheim has retreated approximately 4.7 miles (7.5 kilometers) between when these Landsat scenes were collected in 1972 (left image) and 2019 (right image). As the glacier lost ice over the last 47 years, the cliff walls along the glacier and the rocky outrcrops in the middle become more exposed.Credits:<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-155">NASA</abbr>/ Chris Shuman</p>

&lt;p&gt;NASA&amp;rsquo;s annual survey of changes in Arctic ice cover greatly expanded its reach this year in a series of flights that began on March 9 and wrapped up on May 12. It was the most ambitious spring campaign in the region for Operation IceBridge (OIB), an airborne mission to monitor ice changes at Earth&amp;rsquo;s poles, which also included a rapid-response flight over a new crack in Petermann Glacier, one of the largest and fastest-changing glaciers in Greenland. Geographically, OIB covered a wider area than ever before, and the new instruments deployed provided denser and more accurate measurements. The mission carried out 39 eight-hour flights in 10 weeks. Of those, 13 focused on surveying sea ice, while the remaining 26 flights targeted land ice. Several flights included collaborations with international Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) missions teams to collect and compare measurements of snow and ice. The first part of the campaign was dedicated to overflying the Arctic Ocean&amp;rsquo;s sea ice cover, plus several fast-changing land ice areas from two sites: Thule Air Base in northwest Greenland and Fairbanks, Alaska. In this campaign, the IceBridge team added an extra base: Longyearbyen, Svalbard. From there, the mission was able to reach areas of the Eurasian side of the Arctic Ocean that had not been explored by IceBridge before. IceBridge also expanded its scope westward with a flight to the western side of the Chukchi Sea, a sea situated between Alaska and Russia. It was the first time the mission ever crossed the International Date Line. Operation IceBridge (OIB) launched a short campaign on July 17, 2017 from Thule Air Base, in northwest Greenland. The IceBridge scientists completed six flights focusing on sea ice that has survived at least one summer. The sea ice flights surveyed melt ponds, the pools of melt water on the ice surface that may contribute to the accelerated retreat of sea ice. IceBridge also flew a set of tracks to locate areas of sea ice that the mission already flew over in March and April, during its regular springtime campaign, to measure how the ice has melted since then.

IceBridge bridges the gap between the ICESat missions.</p>\r\n<p>NASA is planning to continue OIB through FY20.</p>\r\n<p>NASA&rsquo;s annual survey of changes in Arctic ice cover greatly expanded its reach this year in a series of flights that began on March 9 and wrapped up on May 12. It was the most ambitious spring campaign in the region for Operation IceBridge (OIB), an airborne mission to monitor ice changes at Earth&rsquo;s poles, which also included a rapid-response flight over a new crack in Petermann Glacier, one of the largest and fastest-changing glaciers in Greenland. Geographically, OIB covered a wider area than ever before, and the new instruments deployed provided denser and more accurate measurements. The mission carried out 39 eight-hour flights in 10 weeks. Of those, 13 focused on surveying sea ice, while the remaining 26 flights targeted land ice. Several flights included collaborations with international Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) missions teams to collect and compare measurements of snow and ice. The first part of the campaign was dedicated to overflying the Arctic Ocean&rsquo;s sea ice cover, plus several fast-changing land ice areas from two sites: Thule Air Base in northwest Greenland and Fairbanks, Alaska. In this campaign, the IceBridge team added an extra base: Longyearbyen, Svalbard. From there, the mission was able to reach areas of the Eurasian side of the Arctic Ocean that had not been explored by IceBridge before. IceBridge also expanded its scope westward with a flight to the western side of the Chukchi Sea, a sea situated between Alaska and Russia. It was the first time the mission ever crossed the International Date Line. Operation IceBridge (OIB) launched a short campaign on July 17, 2017 from Thule Air Base, in northwest Greenland. The IceBridge scientists completed six flights focusing on sea ice that has survived at least one summer. The sea ice flights surveyed melt ponds, the pools of melt water on the ice surface that may contribute to the accelerated retreat of sea ice. IceBridge also flew a set of tracks to locate areas of sea ice that the mission already flew over in March and April, during its regular springtime campaign, to measure how the ice has melted since then. For its third and final Arctic campaign of 2017, starting in early September, OIB&nbsp; operated from both Thule and Kangerlussuaq to replicate land ice missions that IceBridge completed this past spring. They completed 15 flights over a broad swath of Greenland's ablation, percolationa and dry snow zones.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"11/2/2017","completed":"November 2, 2017","followupvalue":"20171102","id":1421,"users":[],"followup":{"text":["Completed","November 2, 2017"]}},{"milestone":214,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"February 5, 2018","shortdate":"2/5/2018","datevalue":"20180205","action":"<p>Determining source-partitioned, monthly freshwater flux to Greenland fjords depends on remote sensing observations of Greenland sea ice and iceberg distributions.

The submarine record spans the period between 1958 and 2000, the satellite altimeter records between 2003 and 2018, and the scatterometer records between 1999 and 2017. Regional changes in ice thickness (since 1958) and within the data release area of the Arctic Ocean, previously reported by Kwok and Rothrock (2009 Geophys. Res. Lett. 36 L15501), have been updated to include the 8 years of CryoSat-2 (CS-2) retrievals. Between the pre-1990 submarine period (1958&ndash;1976) and the CS-2 period (2011&ndash;2018) the average thickness near the end of the melt season, in six regions, decreased by 2.0mor some 66% over six decades. Within the data release area (~38% of the Arctic Ocean) of submarine ice draft, the thinning of ~1.75min winter since 1980 (maximum thickness of 3.64min the regression analysis) has not changed significantly; the mean thickness over the CS-2 period is&sim;2m. The 15 year satellite record depicts losses in sea ice volume at 2870km3/decade and 5130km3/decade in winter (February&ndash;March) and fall (October&ndash;November), respectively: more moderate trends compared to the sharp decreases over the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-125\">ICESat</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>period, where the losses were weighted by record-setting melt in 2007. Over the scatterometer record (1999&ndash;2017), the Arctic has lost more than 2&Aring;~106km2 of MYI&mdash;a decrease of more than 50%; MYI now covers less than one-third of the Arctic Ocean. Independent MYI coverage and volume records co-vary in time, the MYI area anomalies explain&sim;85% of the variance in the anomalies in Arctic sea ice volume. If losses of MYI continue, Arctic thickness/volume will be controlled by seasonal ice, suggesting that the thickness/volume trends will be more moderate (as seen here) but more sensitive to climate forcing.</p>\r\n<p><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\">NASA</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>scientist Ron Kwok contributed to this performance element through the following project focus:<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\">NASA</abbr>&rsquo;s Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (<abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-125\">ICESat</abbr>-2) was launched in September of 2018.

Journal of Climate, 31(20), 8441-8462. https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-18-0125.1Abstract: Precipitation over the Arctic Ocean has a significant impact on the basin-scale freshwater and energy budgets but is one of the most poorly constrained variables in atmospheric reanalyses. Precipitation controls the snow cover on sea ice, which impedes the exchange of energy between the ocean and atmosphere, inhibiting sea ice growth. Thus, accurate precipitation amounts are needed to inform sea ice modeling, especially for the production of thickness estimates from satellite altimetry freeboard data. However, obtaining a quantitative estimate of the precipitation distribution in the Arctic is notoriously difficult because of a number of factors, including a lack of reliable, long-term in situ observations; difficulties in remote sensing over sea ice; and model biases in temperature and moisture fields and associated uncertainty of modeled cloud microphysical processes in the polar regions. Here, we compare precipitation estimates over the Arctic Ocean from eight widely used atmospheric reanalyses over the period 2000&ndash;16 (nominally the &ldquo;new Arctic&rdquo;). We find that the magnitude, frequency, and phase of precipitation vary drastically, although interannual variability is similar. Reanalysis-derived precipitation does not increase with time as expected; however, an increasing trend of higher fractions of liquid precipitation (rainfall) is found. When compared with drifting ice mass balance buoys, three reanalyses (ERA-Interim,<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-360\">MERRA</abbr>, and<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-381\">NCEP</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>R2) produce realistic magnitudes and temporal agreement with observed precipitation events, while two products [<abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-360\">MERRA</abbr>, version 2 (<abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-360\">MERRA</abbr>-2), and CFSR] show large, implausible magnitudes in precipitation events. All the reanalyses tend to produce overly frequent Arctic precipitation. Future work needs to be undertaken to determine the specific factors in reanalyses that contribute to these discrepancies in the new Arctic.</p>\r\n<p>On Aug 28, 2019<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\">NASA</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>released a feature entitled, Landsat Illustrates Five Decades of Change to Greenland Glaciers at https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/landsat-illustrates-five-decades-of-change-to-greenland-glaciers.Ice fronts have retreated, rocky peaks are more exposed, fewer icebergs drift to the ocean: the branching network of glaciers that empty into Greenland&rsquo;s Sermilik Fjord has changed significantly in the last half century. Comparing Landsat images from 1972 and 2019, those changes and more come into view.</p>\r\n<p>The glaciers appear brownish grey in this true-color Landsat 8 satellite image from Aug. 12, 2019. The color indicates that the surface has melted, a process that concentrates dust and rock particles and leads to a darker recrystallized ice sheet surface.</p>\r\n<p>The darker melt surface in 2019 extends much farther onto the ice sheet than it did in 1972, when the first Landsat satellite gathered data on the area, said Christopher Shuman, a glaciologist with the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, at<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\">NASA</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Landsat is a joint mission of<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\">NASA</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>and the U.S. Geological Survey.</p>\r\n<p>Helheim Glacier, one of the largest and fastest flowing of its kind in Greenland, has retreated approximately 4.7 miles (7.5 kilometers) up a wide fjord in the time between the two scenes, leaving a jumble of sea ice where its calving front used to be. To the east, Midgard Glacier has retreated approximately 10 miles (16 kilometers), splitting into two branches farther up the fjord. Changes to the rocky outcrops of the area&rsquo;s mountains and smaller tributary glaciers are also visible by comparing the two Landsat images.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot more bare rock visible now, which used to be covered with ice,&rdquo; Shuman said. &ldquo;And all these little glaciers are all getting slammed, as well as the bigger ones like Helheim, Fenris and Midgard. There are scores of examples of change just in this one area.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>In a close-up of the Helheim Glacier, a patch of open water is visible right at the calving front. Three days after Landsat 8 collected the image over Helheim and its neighboring glaciers,<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\">NASA</abbr>&rsquo;s Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) project flew over that open patch of water in an airplane and dropped a temperature-measuring probe that detected warm water at the ice front. OMG is examining how oceans melt glaciers from below, even as air temperatures warm the ice from above.</p>\r\n<p>Unusually warm air temperatures this summer have caused record melt across Greenland. Approximately 90% of the surface of Greenland&rsquo;s ice sheet melted at some point between July 30 and Aug. 2, during which time an estimated 55 billion tons of ice melted into the ocean, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Shuman also tracked the unusual warm weather at the top of the Greenland Ice Sheet, 10,550 feet (3,216 meters) above sea level, where temperatures were above freezing for more than 16.5 hours total during July 30 and 31.ATTACHED PHOTOSCaption 1: Glaciers in southeastern Greenland including, from left, Helheim, Fenris and Midgard are seen in a Landsat 8 image from Aug. 12, 2019 (right image), and a composite image from Landsat 1 scenes collected in September 1972 (left image).

As of July-2020, GRACE-FO has provided 24 global monthly mass changemaps, adding two additional years to the 15-year global mass change data recordfrom GRACE (2002-2017). The GRACE-FO Science Data System team determined thatno biases exist between the GRACE and GRACE‐FO records and that the level of measurementsystem performance is allowing GRACE‐FO to meet its goal of extending theoriginal GRACE record at an equivalent precision and spatiotemporal sampling. Through early2019, GRACE-FO detected reduced mass loss on the Greenland ice sheet,consistent with observations from NASA&rsquo;s Oceans Melting Greenlandinvestigation. However, this was followed by a record-breaking 2019 summer meltseason, with the Greenland ice sheet losing 223 &plusmn; 12 Gt/month during the monthof July alone, and a record annual mass loss of 532 &plusmn; 58 Gt/yr (Sasgen et al.,2020; Velicogna et al., 2019). Seven of the glacial regions (outside ofGreenland and Antarctica) that dominate global ice mass losses are melting atan accelerated rate: Alaska, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, the SouthernAndes, High Mountain Asia, the Russian Arctic, Iceland and the Norwegianarchipelago Svalbard, with the five Arctic regions accounting for the greatestshare of ice loss (Cirac&igrave; et al., 2020).

Extending the global masschange data record: GRACE Follow-On instrument and science data performance.Geophysical Research Letters, 47, e2020GL088306. https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL088306AbstractSince June, 2018, the Gravity Recovery and Climate ExperimentFollow‐On (GRACE‐FO) is extending the 15‐year monthly mass change record of the GRACE mission, whichended in June 2017. The GRACE‐FO instrument and flight system performancehas improved over GRACE. Better attitude solutions and enhanced pointing performance result in reduced fuel consumption and gravity range rate post‐fit residuals. One accelerometer requires additionalcalibrations due to unexpected measurement noise. The GRACE‐FO gravity and mass change fields from June 2018 throughDecember 2019 continue the GRACE record at an equivalent precision andspatiotemporal sampling. During this period, GRACE‐FO observed large interannual terrestrial water variationsassociated with excess rainfall (Central US, Middle East), drought (Europe,Australia), and ice melt (Greenland). These observations are consistent withindependent mass change estimates, providing high confidence that nointermission biases exist from GRACE to GRACE‐FO, despite the 11‐month gap. GRACE‐FO has also successfully demonstratedsatellite‐to‐satellite laser ranging interferometry. Sasgen I., Wouters,B., Gardner, A.S., King, M.D., Tedesco, M., Landerer, F.W., Dahle, C., Save,H., Fettweis, X. (2020), Return to rapid ice loss in Greenland and record lossin 2019 1 detected by the GRACE-FO satellites, Nature Communications Earth&amp; Environment. https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-020-0010-1AbstractBetween 2003-2016, theGreenland ice sheet (GrIS) was one of the largest contributors to sealevel rise, as it lost about 255 Gt of ice per year. This mass loss slowed in2017 and 2018 to about 100 Gt yr&minus;1. Herewe examine further changes in rate of GrIS mass loss, by analyzing data fromthe GRACE-FO (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment &ndash; Follow On) satellitemission, launched in May 2018. Using simulations with regional climate modelswe show that the mass losses observed in 2017 and 2018 by the GRACE andGRACE-FO missions are lower than in any other two year period between 2003 and2019, the combined period of the two missions. We find that this reduced iceloss results from two anomalous cold summers in western Greenland, compoundedby snow-rich autumn and winter conditions in the east. For 2019, GRACE-FOreveals a return to high melt rates leading to a mass loss of 223&thinsp;&plusmn;&thinsp;12 Gt month&minus;1 duringthe month of July alone, and a record annual mass loss of 532&thinsp;&plusmn;&thinsp;58 Gt yr&minus;1.

Continuity of ice sheet mass loss inGreenland and Antarctica from the GRACE and GRACE Follow-On missions.Geophysical Research Letters, 47, e2020GL087291. https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL087291.AbstractWe examine data continuity between the Gravity Recovery andClimate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow‐On (FO) missions overGreenland and Antarctica using independent data from the mass budget method,which calculates the difference between ice sheet surface mass balance and icedischarge at the periphery. For both ice sheets, we find consistent GRACE/GRACE‐FOtime series across the data gap, at the continental and regional scales, andthe data gap is confidently filled with mass budget method data. In Greenland,the GRACE‐FO data reveal an exceptional summer loss of 600 Gt in 2019following two cold summers. In Antarctica, ongoing high mass losses in theAmundsen Sea Embayment of West Antarctica, the Antarctic Peninsula, and WilkesLand in East Antarctica cumulate to 2130, 560, and 370 Gt, respectively,since 2002. A cumulative mass gain of 980 Gt in Queen Maud Land since2009, however, led to a pause in the acceleration in mass loss from Antarcticaafter 2016. Cirac&igrave;,E., Velicogna, I., &amp; Swenson, S. (2020). Continuity of the mass loss of theworld's glaciers and ice caps from the GRACE and GRACE Follow-On missions.Geophysical Research Letters, 47, e2019GL086926. https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GL086926AbstractWe use time series oftime‐variable gravity from the Gravitational Recovery and Climate Experiment(GRACE) and GRACE Follow‐On (GRACE‐FO) missions to evaluate the mass balance of the world's glaciers andice caps (GIC) for the time period April 2002 to September 2019, excludingAntarctica and Greenland peripheral glaciers. We demonstrate continuity of themass balance record across the GRACE/GRACE‐FO data gap usingindependent data from the GMAO Modern‐Era RetrospectiveAnalysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA‐2)reanalysis. We report an average mass loss of 281.5 &plusmn; 30 Gt/yr,an acceleration of 50 &plusmn; 20 Gt/yr per decade, and a 13‐mmcumulative sea level rise for the analyzed period. Seven regions dominate themass loss, with the largest share from the Arctic: Alaska(72.5 &plusmn; 8 Gt/yr), Canadian Arctic Archipelago(73.0 &plusmn; 9 Gt/yr), Southern Andes (30.4 &plusmn; 13 Gt/yr),High Mountain Asia (HMA) (28.8 &plusmn; 11 Gt/yr), Russian Arctic(20.2 &plusmn; 6 Gt/yr), Iceland (15.9 &plusmn; 4 Gt/yr), andSvalbard (12.1 &plusmn; 4 Gt/yr). At the regional level, the analysisof acceleration is complicated by a strong interannual to decadal variabilityin mass balance that is well reproduced by the GRACE‐calibratedMERRA‐2 data.</p>\r\n<p>NASA's Landsat Science Team is shaping the acquisition plan for Landsat 8 to cover Arctic and Antarctic regions that are slightly beyond the traditional latitude range of the satellite, coveringfor example the farthest northern coasts of Ellesmere Island and Greenland forthe first time in the Landsat record.

The team will drill through the ice at sites in northern Greenland, sample bedrock obtained from those cores, and analyze a suite of cosmogenic nuclides (Beryllium-10, Aluminum-26, Chlorine-36, Carbon-14, and Neon-21) that can act as signatures of changes to the GrIS margin. These data will deliver direct observations of periods when the GrIS was substantially smaller than today and ice sheet margins retreated inland. Results will be incorporated into a numerical ice sheet model with a built-in cosmogenic nuclide module to identify plausible ice sheet histories. The modeling experiments will help understand the mechanisms and climate forcing underlying past periods of ice sheet retreat and help inform predictions of the future. Based on the melting scenarios, a first-order map of sea level rise fingerprints and inundation scenarios for major port cities will be produced.&lt;/p&gt;" data-action-deadline="" data-action-completed="8/21/2020" data-action-contacts="[{&quot;id&quot;:1080,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Kate Ruck&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:&quot;/members/people/4560&quot;}]">

Nature Geosciencevolume 12, pages277&amp;ndash;283. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0329-3Abstract: Jakobshavn Isbrae has been the single largest source of mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet over the last 20 years. During that time, it has been retreating, accelerating and thinning. Here we use airborne altimetry and satellite imagery to show that since 2016 Jakobshavn has been re-advancing, slowing and thickening. We link these changes to concurrent cooling of ocean waters in Disko Bay that spill over into Ilulissat Icefjord. Ocean temperatures in the bay&amp;rsquo;s upper 250&amp;thinsp;m have cooled to levels not seen since the mid 1980s. Observations and modelling trace the origins of this cooling to anomalous wintertime heat loss in the boundary current that circulates around the southern half of Greenland. Longer time series of ocean temperature, subglacial discharge and glacier variability strongly suggest that ocean-induced melting at the front has continued to influence glacier dynamics after the disintegration of its floating tongue in 2003. We conclude that projections of Jakobshavn&amp;rsquo;s future contribution to sea-level rise that are based on glacier geometry are insufficient, and that accounting for external forcing is indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;" data-action-deadline="" data-action-completed="10/4/2019" data-action-contacts="[{&quot;id&quot;:279,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Christine Mataya&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:&quot;/members/people/286&quot;}]">

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract: The possibility that a deep mantle plume manifests Pliocene and Quaternary volcanism and potential elevated heat flux in West Antarctica has been studied for more than 30 years. Recent seismic images support the plume hypothesis as the cause of Marie Byrd Land (MBL) volcanism and geophysical structure. Mantle plumes may more than double the geothermal heat flux above nominal continental values. A dearth of in situ ice sheet basal data exists that samples the heat flux. Consequently, we examine a realistic distribution of heat flux associated with a possible late Cenozoic mantle plume in West Antarctica and explore its impact on thermal and melt conditions at the ice sheet base. We use a simple analytical mantle plume parameterization to produce geothermal heat flux at the base of the ice sheet. The three-dimensional ice flow model includes an enthalpy framework and full-Stokes stress balance. As both the putative plume location and extent are uncertain, we perform broadly scoped experiments to characterize the impact of the plume on geothermal heat flux and ice sheet basal conditions. The experiments show that mantle plumes have an important local impact on the ice sheet, with basal melting rates reaching several centimeters per year directly above the hotspot. In order to be consistent with observations of basal hydrology in MBL, the upper bound on the plume-derived geothermal heat flux is 150 mW/m2. In contrast, the active lake system of the lower part of Whillans Ice Stream suggests a widespread anomalous mantle heat flux, linked to a rift source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of even greater impact is the research published on the relation between individual drainage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;system (Rink is the outlet glacier of one in Greenland) to future and present-day rates of inundation globally, using the same basic self-gravitating elastically deforming rotating earth model (ISSM-SESAW). The paper reference is:&lt;/p&gt;

By exhaustively mapping these fingerprint gradients, we form a new diagnosis tool, henceforth referred to as gradient fingerprint mapping (GFM), that readily allows for improved assessments of future coastal inundation or emergence. We demonstrate that for Antarctica and Greenland, changes in the predictions of inundation at major port cities depend on the location of the drainage system. For example, in London, GFM shows LSL that is significantly affected by changes on the western part of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS), whereas in New York, LSL change predictions are greatly sensitive to changes in the northeastern portions of the GrIS.

Had it&#39;s third science team meeting, where early results were presented from the ship-based bathymetry surveys in 2015 and 2016.&amp;nbsp; With these data, we are beginning to get a sense of which glaciers&amp;nbsp;sit in deep fjords and work is ongoing to connect these observations of seafloor depth with estimates of the bedrock depth below the glaciers.&amp;nbsp; This is a key activity for helping us understand how much of the ice sheet could be affected by changes in the oceans.&amp;nbsp; In addition, early looks at the airborne gravity observations, collected in 2016 are providing additional estimates of seafloor depth.&amp;nbsp; Finally, we are beginning to analyze oceanographic data from the ship surveys and last year&#39;s AXCTD survey.&amp;nbsp; Earl indications suggest long-term warming in East Greenland. Three initial OMG publications are as follows: 1) Oceans Melting Greenland: Early Results from NASA&amp;rsquo;s Ocean-Ice Mission in Greenland, Ian Fenty, Josh K. Willis, et al. Early results suggest that many glaciers terminate in deep water and are hence vulnerable to increased melting due to ocean-ice interaction. Fenty, I., J.K. Willis, A. Khazendar, S. Dinardo, R. Forsberg, I. Fukumori, D. Holland, M. Jakobsson, D. Moller, J. Morison, A. M&amp;uuml;nchow, E. Rignot, M. Schodlok, A.F. Thompson, K. Tinto, M. Rutherford, and N. Trenholm. 2016. Oceans Melting Greenland: Early results from NASA&amp;rsquo;s ocean-ice mission in Greenland. Oceanography 29(4):72&amp;ndash;83, https://doi.org/10.5670/oceanog.2016.100. ABSTRACT. Melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet represents a major uncertainty in projecting future rates of global sea level rise. Much of this uncertainty is related to a lack of knowledge about subsurface ocean hydrographic properties, particularly heat content, how these properties are modified across the continental shelf, and about the extent to which the ocean interacts with glaciers. Early results from NASA&amp;rsquo;s five-year Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) mission, based on extensive hydrographic and bathymetric surveys, suggest that many glaciers terminate in deep water and are hence vulnerable to increased melting due to ocean-ice interaction. OMG will track ocean conditions and ice loss at glaciers around Greenland through the year 2020, providing critical information about ocean-driven Greenland ice mass loss in a warming climate. 2) Improving Bed Topography Mapping of Greenland Glaciers Using NASA&amp;rsquo;s Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) Data, Mathieu Morlighem, Eric Rignot, and Josh K. Willis et al. Northwest coast of Greenland reveals complex structural features in bed elevation, such as valleys, ridges, bumps, and hollows, which have important implications for both channeling ice flow toward the continental margin, and for controlling the amount of warm, salty Atlantic Water that reaches the glaciers. Morlighem, M., E. Rignot, and J.K. Willis. 2016. Improving bed topography mapping of Greenland glaciers using NASA&amp;rsquo;s Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) data. Oceanography 29(4):62&amp;ndash;71, https://doi.org/10.5670/oceanog.2016.99. ABSTRACT. Melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet has the potential to raise sea level by 7.36 m and is already contributing to global sea level rise at a rate higher than 1 mm yr&lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Computer models are our best tools to make projections of the mass balance of Greenland over the next centuries, but these models rely on bed topography data that remain poorly constrained near glacier termini. Accurate bed topography in the vicinity of calving fronts is critical for numerical models, as the shapes of the glacier bed and of the nearby bathymetry control both the ocean circulation in the fjord and the stability and response of the ice sheet to climate warming. NASA&amp;rsquo;s Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) mission is collecting bathymetry data along Greenland fjords at several glacier termini. Here, we show that these measurements are transforming our knowledge of fjord and glacier depths. Using a mass conservation approach, we combine OMG bathymetry with observations of ice velocity and thickness to produce estimates of bed depth and ice thickness across the ice-ocean boundary with unprecedented accuracy and reliability. Our results along the northwest coast of Greenland reveal complex structural features in bed elevation, such as valleys, ridges, bumps, and hollows. These features have important implications for both channeling ice flow toward the continental margin, and for controlling the amount of warm, salty Atlantic Water that reaches the glaciers. 3) The Ice Shelf of Petermann Gletscher, North Greenland, and Its Connection to the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, Andreas M&amp;uuml;nchow, Laurie Padman, Peter Washam, and Keith W. Nicholls Floating ice shelf is strongly coupled to the ocean below and to Nares Strait at time scales from tidal to interannual. M&amp;uuml;nchow, A., L. Padman, P. Washam, and K.W. Nicholls. 2016. The ice shelf of Petermann Gletscher, North Greenland, and its connection to the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans. Oceanography 29(4):84&amp;ndash;95, https://doi.org/10.5670/oceanog.2016.101 Abstract: Petermann Gletscher in North Greenland features the second largest floating ice shelf in the Northern Hemisphere. This paper describes the history of its exploration and presents new ocean and glacier observations. We find that the floating ice shelf is strongly coupled to the ocean below and to Nares Strait at time scales from tidal to interannual. Our observations cover the 2012 to 2016 period after two large calving events took place in 2010 and 2012 that reduced the ice shelf area by 380 km2 to about 870 km2 today.

                <p></p><p>Since the beginning of the year NASA's Ocean Melting Greenland (OMG) campaign: Flew its second year of the GLISTIN survey, which is designed to collect elevation maps overall marine terminating glaciers in Greenland.&nbsp; We are still processing the 2017 data, but we are beginning to look at elevation changes between 2016 and 2017 for a number of glaciers around Greenland. Had it's third science team meeting, where early results were presented from the ship-based bathymetry surveys in 2015 and 2016.&nbsp; With these data, we are beginning to get a sense of which glaciers&nbsp;sit in deep fjords and work is ongoing to connect these observations of seafloor depth with estimates of the bedrock depth below the glaciers.&nbsp; This is a key activity for helping us understand how much of the ice sheet could be affected by changes in the oceans.&nbsp; In addition, early looks at the airborne gravity observations, collected in 2016 are providing additional estimates of seafloor depth.&nbsp; Finally, we are beginning to analyze oceanographic data from the ship surveys and last year's AXCTD survey.&nbsp; Earl indications suggest long-term warming in East Greenland. Three initial OMG publications are as follows: 1) Oceans Melting Greenland: Early Results from NASA’s Ocean-Ice Mission in Greenland, Ian Fenty, Josh K. Willis, et al. Early results suggest that many glaciers terminate in deep water and are hence vulnerable to increased melting due to ocean-ice interaction. Fenty, I., J.K. Willis, A. Khazendar, S. Dinardo, R. Forsberg, I. Fukumori, D. Holland, M. Jakobsson, D. Moller, J. Morison, A. Münchow, E. Rignot, M. Schodlok, A.F. Thompson, K. Tinto, M. Rutherford, and N. Trenholm. 2016. Oceans Melting Greenland: Early results from NASA’s ocean-ice mission in Greenland. Oceanography 29(4):72–83, https://doi.org/10.5670/oceanog.2016.100. ABSTRACT. Melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet represents a major uncertainty in projecting future rates of global sea level rise. Much of this uncertainty is related to a lack of knowledge about subsurface ocean hydrographic properties, particularly heat content, how these properties are modified across the continental shelf, and about the extent to which the ocean interacts with glaciers. Early results from NASA’s five-year Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) mission, based on extensive hydrographic and bathymetric surveys, suggest that many glaciers terminate in deep water and are hence vulnerable to increased melting due to ocean-ice interaction. OMG will track ocean conditions and ice loss at glaciers around Greenland through the year 2020, providing critical information about ocean-driven Greenland ice mass loss in a warming climate. 2) Improving Bed Topography Mapping of Greenland Glaciers Using NASA’s Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) Data, Mathieu Morlighem, Eric Rignot, and Josh K. Willis et al. Northwest coast of Greenland reveals complex structural features in bed elevation, such as valleys, ridges, bumps, and hollows, which have important implications for both channeling ice flow toward the continental margin, and for controlling the amount of warm, salty Atlantic Water that reaches the glaciers. Morlighem, M., E. Rignot, and J.K. Willis. 2016. Improving bed topography mapping of Greenland glaciers using NASA’s Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) data. Oceanography 29(4):62–71, https://doi.org/10.5670/oceanog.2016.99. ABSTRACT. Melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet has the potential to raise sea level by 7.36 m and is already contributing to global sea level rise at a rate higher than 1 mm yr<sup>–1</sup>. Computer models are our best tools to make projections of the mass balance of Greenland over the next centuries, but these models rely on bed topography data that remain poorly constrained near glacier termini. Accurate bed topography in the vicinity of calving fronts is critical for numerical models, as the shapes of the glacier bed and of the nearby bathymetry control both the ocean circulation in the fjord and the stability and response of the ice sheet to climate warming. NASA’s Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) mission is collecting bathymetry data along Greenland fjords at several glacier termini. Here, we show that these measurements are transforming our knowledge of fjord and glacier depths. Using a mass conservation approach, we combine OMG bathymetry with observations of ice velocity and thickness to produce estimates of bed depth and ice thickness across the ice-ocean boundary with unprecedented accuracy and reliability. Our results along the northwest coast of Greenland reveal complex structural features in bed elevation, such as valleys, ridges, bumps, and hollows. These features have important implications for both channeling ice flow toward the continental margin, and for controlling the amount of warm, salty Atlantic Water that reaches the glaciers. 3) The Ice Shelf of Petermann Gletscher, North Greenland, and Its Connection to the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, Andreas Münchow, Laurie Padman, Peter Washam, and Keith W. Nicholls Floating ice shelf is strongly coupled to the ocean below and to Nares Strait at time scales from tidal to interannual. Münchow, A., L. Padman, P. Washam, and K.W. Nicholls. 2016. The ice shelf of Petermann Gletscher, North Greenland, and its connection to the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans. Oceanography 29(4):84–95, https://doi.org/10.5670/oceanog.2016.101 Abstract: Petermann Gletscher in North Greenland features the second largest floating ice shelf in the Northern Hemisphere. This paper describes the history of its exploration and presents new ocean and glacier observations. We find that the floating ice shelf is strongly coupled to the ocean below and to Nares Strait at time scales from tidal to interannual. Our observations cover the 2012 to 2016 period after two large calving events took place in 2010 and 2012 that reduced the ice shelf area by 380 km2 to about 870 km2 today. A potential third breakup, of an additional 150 km2, is anticipated by a large fracture that extends from the margin to the center of the glacier.&nbsp;</p><p></p>

The purpose was to define a path forward for a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observation network in Greenland. There are many means for determining Greenland ice mass loss, but almost all rely on some form of satellite positioning, generally using GNSS or its subset Global Positioning System (GPS). Thus a network of geodetic-quality GNSS receivers is desirable. The goals of the workshop were: Elucidate the current state of the network, Illustrate the current uses of network data (eg. Geodessey, Crustal deformation, Campaign GNSS reference, atmospheric modeling, Space weather/ionosphere ), Identify potential new utility of the data, Determine the optimal configuration moving forward: Ideal number of stations, Placement of stations, Replacement and upgrade of stations, data management.</p>\r\n<p>The workshop brought together: investigators using data produced by the current network, potential new investigators who can make use of GNSS network data, experts in the use of GNSS data for positioning, experts in the use of GNSS as a remote-sensing tool (atmospheric water vapor, ionospheric electron content, and multipath utilization for sensing of conditions prox- imal to the station such as snow depth, vegetation, and mapping of transient areas covered by liquid water), and the people involved in actually deploying GNSS reference stations around Greenland.</p>\r\n<p>A 37-page white paper was produced by the workshop participants with five specific recommendations: 1) Continue to support the continuous and autonomous operation of the current configuration of GNET; 2) Maximize the utility of the current data by promoting the existing data distribution model; 3) Encouraging new uses of GNET data, such as tropospheric zenith delay analyses to improve atmospheric models; 4) Densify the current network to better resolve those areas of maximum gradient in GIA and/or regions of rapid glacier change; and 5) Consider a scoring scheme for evaluating the relative importance of existing stations. The report discusses: the current state of the network; current and future science using GNET data; data management; and the best configuration moving forward.</p>\r\n<p>A paper using GNET data also was published in Geophysical Research Letters by S. Adhikari, E. R. Ivins, and E. Larour in May 2017 available at: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL073478/full. The abstract is below. The annual cycle and secular trend of Greenland mass loading are well recorded in measurements of solid Earth deformation. Horizontal crustal displacements can potentially track the spatiotemporal detail of mass changes with great fidelity. Our analysis of Greenland crustal motion data reveals that a significant excitation of horizontal amplitudes occurs during the intense melt years. We discover that solitary seasonal waves of substantial mass transport (1.67 &plusmn; 0.54 Gt/month) traveled at an average speed of 7.1 km/month through Rink Glacier in 2012. We deduce that intense surface melting enhanced either basal lubrication or softening of shear margins, or both, causing the glacier to thin dynamically in summer. The newly routed upstream subglacial water was likely to be both retarded and inefficient, thus providing a causal mechanism for the prolonged ice transport to continue well into the winter months. As the climate continues to produce increasingly warmer spring and summer, amplified seasonal waves of mass transport may become ever more present with important ramifications for the future sea level rise.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"9/29/2017","completed":"September 29, 2017","followupvalue":"20170929","id":1329,"users":[],"followup":{"text":["Completed","September 29, 2017"]}},{"milestone":172,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"September 29, 2017","shortdate":"9/29/2017","datevalue":"20170929","action":"<p>Since the beginning of the year NASA's Ocean Melting Greenland (OMG) campaign: Flew its second year of the GLISTIN survey, which is designed to collect elevation maps overall marine terminating glaciers in Greenland.&nbsp; We are still processing the 2017 data, but we are beginning to look at elevation changes between 2016 and 2017 for a number of glaciers around Greenland.

Recent seismic images support the plume hypothesis as the cause of Marie Byrd Land (MBL) volcanism and geophysical structure. Mantle plumes may more than double the geothermal heat flux above nominal continental values. A dearth of in situ ice sheet basal data exists that samples the heat flux. Consequently, we examine a realistic distribution of heat flux associated with a possible late Cenozoic mantle plume in West Antarctica and explore its impact on thermal and melt conditions at the ice sheet base. We use a simple analytical mantle plume parameterization to produce geothermal heat flux at the base of the ice sheet. The three-dimensional ice flow model includes an enthalpy framework and full-Stokes stress balance. As both the putative plume location and extent are uncertain, we perform broadly scoped experiments to characterize the impact of the plume on geothermal heat flux and ice sheet basal conditions. The experiments show that mantle plumes have an important local impact on the ice sheet, with basal melting rates reaching several centimeters per year directly above the hotspot. In order to be consistent with observations of basal hydrology in MBL, the upper bound on the plume-derived geothermal heat flux is 150 mW/m2. In contrast, the active lake system of the lower part of Whillans Ice Stream suggests a widespread anomalous mantle heat flux, linked to a rift source.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Of even greater impact is the research published on the relation between individual drainage</p>\r\n<p>system (Rink is the outlet glacier of one in Greenland) to future and present-day rates of inundation globally, using the same basic self-gravitating elastically deforming rotating earth model (ISSM-SESAW).

As land ice is lost to the oceans, both the Earth&rsquo;s gravitational and rotational potentials are perturbed, resulting in strong spatial patterns in<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-215\">SLR</abbr>, termed sea-level fingerprints. We lack robust forecasting models for future ice changes, which diminishes our ability to use these fingerprints to accurately predict local sea-level (LSL) changes. We exploit an advanced mathematical property of adjoint systems and determine the exact gradient of sea-level fingerprints with respect to local variations in the ice thickness of all of the world&rsquo;s ice drainage systems. By exhaustively mapping these fingerprint gradients, we form a new diagnosis tool, henceforth referred to as gradient fingerprint mapping (GFM), that readily allows for improved assessments of future coastal inundation or emergence. We demonstrate that for Antarctica and Greenland, changes in the predictions of inundation at major port cities depend on the location of the drainage system. For example, in London, GFM shows LSL that is significantly affected by changes on the western part of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS), whereas in New York, LSL change predictions are greatly sensitive to changes in the northeastern portions of the GrIS. We apply GFM to 293 major port cities to allow coastal planners to readily calculate LSL change as more reliable predictions of cryospheric mass changes become available.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"9/30/2018","completed":"September 30, 2018","followupvalue":"20180930","id":1865,"users":[{"id":279,"name":"Christine Mataya","link":"/members/people/286"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","September 30, 2018"]}},{"milestone":172,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"September 18, 2019","shortdate":"9/18/2019","datevalue":"20190918","action":"<p>The National Science Foundation has recently awarded OPP &ndash; 1917528.

A crevasse-centered mathematical approach that integrates physical processes and machine learning will be applied in observation, analysis, and modeling.

Nature Geosciencevolume 12, pages277&ndash;283. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0329-3Abstract: Jakobshavn Isbrae has been the single largest source of mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet over the last 20 years. During that time, it has been retreating, accelerating and thinning. Here we use airborne altimetry and satellite imagery to show that since 2016 Jakobshavn has been re-advancing, slowing and thickening. We link these changes to concurrent cooling of ocean waters in Disko Bay that spill over into Ilulissat Icefjord. Ocean temperatures in the bay&rsquo;s upper 250&thinsp;m have cooled to levels not seen since the mid 1980s. Observations and modelling trace the origins of this cooling to anomalous wintertime heat loss in the boundary current that circulates around the southern half of Greenland. Longer time series of ocean temperature, subglacial discharge and glacier variability strongly suggest that ocean-induced melting at the front has continued to influence glacier dynamics after the disintegration of its floating tongue in 2003. We conclude that projections of Jakobshavn&rsquo;s future contribution to sea-level rise that are based on glacier geometry are insufficient, and that accounting for external forcing is indispensable.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"10/4/2019","completed":"October 4, 2019","followupvalue":"20191004","id":2253,"users":[{"id":279,"name":"Christine Mataya","link":"/members/people/286"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","October 4, 2019"]}},{"milestone":172,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"November 11, 2019","shortdate":"11/11/2019","datevalue":"20191111","action":"<p><span><a href=\"/members/events/12713\"><strong>Glaciers &amp; Sea Level and Modeling Joint Meeting October 10th Meeting</strong></a><strong><span>&nbsp;</span>(</strong><a href=\"/members/documents/15537\"><strong>Agenda</strong></a><strong>,<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><a href=\"/members/events/12713\"><strong>Notes (see comments)</strong></a><strong>,<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><a href=\"/members/events/12713\"><strong>Recording</strong></a><strong>):</strong></span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em><span>Topic:<span>&nbsp;</span></span></em><span>Straight to the Sea: Calving Arctic Ice</span></li>\r\n<li><em>Presentations:</em>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span><a href=\"/members/documents/15474\">Simulating 21st century iceberg calving from the Greenland Ice Sheet with SERMeQ</a>-<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"/members/people/7723\">Lizz Ultee</a><span>&nbsp;</span>(MIT)</span></li>\r\n<li><span><a href=\"/members/documents/15473\">Revisiting and revising models for crevasse depth</a>-<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"/members/people/15441\">Chris Borstad<span>&nbsp;</span></a>(MSU)</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><em><span>Highlights:<span>&nbsp;</span></span></em>This meeting explored the unknowns in science related to processes of calving of small glaciers and crevasse cracking, which are important to resolve in order to better predict sea-level rise.

The Greenland Ice Sheet&amp;rsquo;s contribution to sea-level rise is accelerating, partly due to the acceleration of ice-sheet flow. Melt from the ice-sheet surface can reach the base of the ice and change ice flow. AS the climate warms and the area of the ice surface undergoing surface melting expands inland, important questions include whether a larger area of the ice-sheet bed will receive injections of meltwater, and whether this will lead to faster flow. In this project, Global Positioning System (GPS) and autonomous phase-sensitive radar units will be deployed over a 16-month period to measure ice-sheet surface velocity, surface and englacial strain, and stress transients around supraglacial lakes and moulins in the mid- to upper-ablation zone. These field data will be used in conjunction with geophysical inverse modeling techniques to compute surface and englacial stress and deformation patterns and to quantify the processes controlling water access to the ice-sheet bed. A major goal of the research is to address fundamental questions that will move us towards being able to describe the dynamic impact of surface-to-bed meltwater transit in prognostic ice-sheet models for both the Greenland Ice Sheet and Antarctic Ice Sheet. Combining observations of englacial strain and surface deformation has the potential to transform understanding of ice-sheet deformation, by allowing an empirical test of the assumption that an elastic model is appropriate for inverting observations of surface deformation of glacial ice on short timescales.&lt;/p&gt;" data-action-deadline="" data-action-completed="8/21/2020" data-action-contacts="[{&quot;id&quot;:1080,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Kate Ruck&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:&quot;/members/people/4560&quot;}]">

                <p></p><p>The National Science Foundation has recently awarded OPP – 2003464. The Greenland Ice Sheet’s contribution to sea-level rise is accelerating, partly due to the acceleration of ice-sheet flow. Melt from the ice-sheet surface can reach the base of the ice and change ice flow. AS the climate warms and the area of the ice surface undergoing surface melting expands inland, important questions include whether a larger area of the ice-sheet bed will receive injections of meltwater, and whether this will lead to faster flow. In this project, Global Positioning System (GPS) and autonomous phase-sensitive radar units will be deployed over a 16-month period to measure ice-sheet surface velocity, surface and englacial strain, and stress transients around supraglacial lakes and moulins in the mid- to upper-ablation zone. These field data will be used in conjunction with geophysical inverse modeling techniques to compute surface and englacial stress and deformation patterns and to quantify the processes controlling water access to the ice-sheet bed. A major goal of the research is to address fundamental questions that will move us towards being able to describe the dynamic impact of surface-to-bed meltwater transit in prognostic ice-sheet models for both the Greenland Ice Sheet and Antarctic Ice Sheet. Combining observations of englacial strain and surface deformation has the potential to transform understanding of ice-sheet deformation, by allowing an empirical test of the assumption that an elastic model is appropriate for inverting observations of surface deformation of glacial ice on short timescales.</p><p></p>

&lt;p&gt;The abstract is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the largest sources of uncertainty in sea level rise prediction is glacial acceleration, of which the surge phenomenon is the least understood type. The surge of the Bering Bagley Glacier System (BBGS), Alaska, in 2011&amp;ndash;2013 has provided a rare opportunity to study the surge phenomenon in a large and complex glacier system. A surge results in widespread crevassing throughout the glacier system complicating many traditional techniques used to study glacier dynamics. In this paper, we utilize crevassing as a means to investigate the recent BBGS surge through numerical modeling and geostatistical data analysis. Following the principles of structural glaciology, image‐based crevasse characterizations are obtained through geostatistical methods applied to Landsat‐7 data, supplemented by airborne field observations. On the modeling side, a 3‐D full‐Stokes finite element model of the BBGS is developed and applied to investigate ice dynamics and surface structures during the recent surge. A von Mises criterion is adopted to simulate crevassing at the glacier surface, oriented along the axes of maximum principal tensile stress. To facilitate evaluation of model‐ and data‐derived crevasse characteristics, three different comparison methods are introduced. General agreement in the model‐data comparisons indicates that the model has the ability to represent the BBGS system during peak acceleration. The crevasse‐based approach is also employed to optimize the basal sliding parameter and the von Mises stress threshold in the model. Results further indicate that bed topography is an important constraint in modeling the surge process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BedMachine v3 published by Morlighem et al., 2013: BedMachine v3: Complete Bed Topography and Ocean Bathymetry Mapping of Greenland From Multibeam Echo Sounding Combined With Mass Conservation. Abstract:Greenland&amp;rsquo;s bed topography is a primary control on ice flow, grounding line migration, calving dynamics, and subglacial drainage.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the largest sources of uncertainty in sea level rise prediction is glacial acceleration, of which the surge phenomenon is the least understood type. The surge of the Bering Bagley Glacier System (BBGS), Alaska, in 2011–2013 has provided a rare opportunity to study the surge phenomenon in a large and complex glacier system. A surge results in widespread crevassing throughout the glacier system complicating many traditional techniques used to study glacier dynamics. In this paper, we utilize crevassing as a means to investigate the recent BBGS surge through numerical modeling and geostatistical data analysis. Following the principles of structural glaciology, image‐based crevasse characterizations are obtained through geostatistical methods applied to Landsat‐7 data, supplemented by airborne field observations. On the modeling side, a 3‐D full‐Stokes finite element model of the BBGS is developed and applied to investigate ice dynamics and surface structures during the recent surge. A von Mises criterion is adopted to simulate crevassing at the glacier surface, oriented along the axes of maximum principal tensile stress. To facilitate evaluation of model‐ and data‐derived crevasse characteristics, three different comparison methods are introduced. General agreement in the model‐data comparisons indicates that the model has the ability to represent the BBGS system during peak acceleration. The crevasse‐based approach is also employed to optimize the basal sliding parameter and the von Mises stress threshold in the model. Results further indicate that bed topography is an important constraint in modeling the surge process.</p>

Abstract:Greenland’s bed topography is a primary control on ice flow, grounding line migration, calving dynamics, and subglacial drainage. Moreover, fjord bathymetry regulates the penetration of warm Atlantic water (AW) that rapidly melts and undercuts Greenland’s marine-terminating glaciers. Here we present a new compilation of Greenland bed topography that assimilates seafloor bathymetry and ice thickness data through a mass conservation approach. A new 150 m horizontal resolution bed topography/ bathymetric map of Greenland is constructed with seamless transitions at the ice/ocean interface, yielding major improvements over previous data sets, particularly in the marine-terminating sectors of northwest and southeast Greenland. Our map reveals that the total sea level potential of the Greenland ice sheet is 7.42 ± 0.05 m, which is 7 cm greater than previous estimates. Furthermore, it explains recent calving front response of numerous outlet glaciers and reveals new pathways by which AW can access glaciers with marine-based basins, thereby highlighting sectors of Greenland that are most vulnerable to future oceanic forcing.</p>

Geophysical Research Letters, 46(9), 4772&amp;ndash;4781. https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GL082786Abstract: The state of the subglacial hydrologic system, which can modify ice motion, is sensitive to the volume and rate of meltwater reaching it. Bare‐ice regions rapidly transport meltwater to the bed via moulins, while in certain accumulation zone regions, meltwater first flows through firn aquifers, which can introduce a substantial delay. We use a subglacial hydrological model forced with idealized meltwater input scenarios to test the effect of this delay on subglacial hydrology. We find that addition of firn‐aquifer water to the subglacial system elevates the inland subglacial water pressure while reducing water pressure and enhancing subglacial channelization near the terminus. This effect dampens seasonal variations in subglacial water pressure and may explain regionally anomalous ice velocity patterns observed in Southeast Greenland. As surface melt rates increase and firn aquifers expand inland, it is crucial to understand how inland drainage of meltwater affects the evolution of the subglacial hydrologic system.&lt;/p&gt;

Seasonal to decadal variability in ice discharge from the Greenland Ice Sheet. The Cryosphere 12, 3813-3825, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3813-2018Abstract: Rapid changes in thickness and velocity have been observed at many marine-terminating glaciers in Greenland, impacting the volume of ice they export, or discharge, from the ice sheet. While annual estimates of ice-sheet-wide discharge have been previously derived, higher-resolution records are required to fully constrain the temporal response of these glaciers to various climatic and mechanical drivers that vary in sub-annual scales. Here we sample outlet glaciers wider than 1&amp;thinsp;km (N=230) to derive the first continuous, ice-sheet-wide record of total ice sheet discharge for the 2000&amp;ndash;2016 period, resolving a seasonal variability of 6&amp;thinsp;%. The amplitude of seasonality varies spatially across the ice sheet from 5&amp;thinsp;% in the southeastern region to 9&amp;thinsp;% in the northwest region. We analyze seasonal to annual variability in the discharge time series with respect to both modeled meltwater runoff, obtained from RACMO2.3p2, and glacier front position changes over the same period. We find that year-to-year changes in total ice sheet discharge are related to annual front changes (r2=0.59, p=10&amp;minus;4) and that the annual magnitude of discharge is closely related to cumulative front position changes (r2=0.79), which show a net retreat of &amp;gt;400&amp;thinsp;km, or an average retreat of &amp;gt;2&amp;thinsp;km, at each surveyed glacier. Neither maximum seasonal runoff or annual runoff totals are correlated to annual discharge, which suggests that larger annual quantities of runoff do not relate to increased annual discharge. Discharge and runoff, however, follow similar patterns of seasonal variability with near-coincident periods of acceleration and seasonal maxima. These results suggest that changes in glacier front position drive secular trends in discharge, whereas the impact of runoff is likely limited to the summer months when observed seasonal variations are substantially controlled by the timing of meltwater input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The abstract is as follows: One of the largest sources of uncertainty in sea level rise prediction is glacial acceleration, of which the surge phenomenon is the least understood type. The surge of the Bering Bagley Glacier System (BBGS), Alaska, in 2011&amp;ndash;2013 has provided a rare opportunity to study the surge phenomenon in a large and complex glacier system. A surge results in widespread crevassing throughout the glacier system complicating many traditional techniques used to study glacier dynamics. In this paper, we utilize crevassing as a means to investigate the recent BBGS surge through numerical modeling and geostatistical data analysis. Following the principles of structural glaciology, image‐based crevasse characterizations are obtained through geostatistical methods applied to Landsat‐7 data, supplemented by airborne field observations. On the modeling side, a 3‐D full‐Stokes finite element model of the BBGS is developed and applied to investigate ice dynamics and surface structures during the recent surge. A von Mises criterion is adopted to simulate crevassing at the glacier surface, oriented along the axes of maximum principal tensile stress. To facilitate evaluation of model‐ and data‐derived crevasse characteristics, three different comparison methods are introduced. General agreement in the model‐data comparisons indicates that the model has the ability to represent the BBGS system during peak acceleration. The crevasse‐based approach is also employed to optimize the basal sliding parameter and the von Mises stress threshold in the model. Results further indicate that bed topography is an important constraint in modeling the surge process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BedMachine v3 published by Morlighem et al., 2013: BedMachine v3: Complete Bed Topography and Ocean Bathymetry Mapping of Greenland From Multibeam Echo Sounding Combined With Mass Conservation. Abstract:Greenland&amp;rsquo;s bed topography is a primary control on ice flow, grounding line migration, calving dynamics, and subglacial drainage. Moreover, fjord bathymetry regulates the penetration of warm Atlantic water (AW) that rapidly melts and undercuts Greenland&amp;rsquo;s marine-terminating glaciers. Here we present a new compilation of Greenland bed topography that assimilates seafloor bathymetry and ice thickness data through a mass conservation approach. A new 150 m horizontal resolution bed topography/ bathymetric map of Greenland is constructed with seamless transitions at the ice/ocean interface, yielding major improvements over previous data sets, particularly in the marine-terminating sectors of northwest and southeast Greenland. Our map reveals that the total sea level potential of the Greenland ice sheet is 7.42 &amp;plusmn; 0.05 m, which is 7 cm greater than previous estimates. Furthermore, it explains recent calving front response of numerous outlet glaciers and reveals new pathways by which AW can access glaciers with marine-based basins, thereby highlighting sectors of Greenland that are most vulnerable to future oceanic forcing.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>The abstract is as follows: One of the largest sources of uncertainty in sea level rise prediction is glacial acceleration, of which the surge phenomenon is the least understood type. The surge of the Bering Bagley Glacier System (BBGS), Alaska, in 2011–2013 has provided a rare opportunity to study the surge phenomenon in a large and complex glacier system. A surge results in widespread crevassing throughout the glacier system complicating many traditional techniques used to study glacier dynamics. In this paper, we utilize crevassing as a means to investigate the recent BBGS surge through numerical modeling and geostatistical data analysis. Following the principles of structural glaciology, image‐based crevasse characterizations are obtained through geostatistical methods applied to Landsat‐7 data, supplemented by airborne field observations. On the modeling side, a 3‐D full‐Stokes finite element model of the BBGS is developed and applied to investigate ice dynamics and surface structures during the recent surge. A von Mises criterion is adopted to simulate crevassing at the glacier surface, oriented along the axes of maximum principal tensile stress. To facilitate evaluation of model‐ and data‐derived crevasse characteristics, three different comparison methods are introduced. General agreement in the model‐data comparisons indicates that the model has the ability to represent the BBGS system during peak acceleration. The crevasse‐based approach is also employed to optimize the basal sliding parameter and the von Mises stress threshold in the model. Results further indicate that bed topography is an important constraint in modeling the surge process.</p>

<p>BedMachine v3 published by Morlighem et al., 2013: BedMachine v3: Complete Bed Topography and Ocean Bathymetry Mapping of Greenland From Multibeam Echo Sounding Combined With Mass Conservation. Abstract:Greenland’s bed topography is a primary control on ice flow, grounding line migration, calving dynamics, and subglacial drainage. Moreover, fjord bathymetry regulates the penetration of warm Atlantic water (AW) that rapidly melts and undercuts Greenland’s marine-terminating glaciers. Here we present a new compilation of Greenland bed topography that assimilates seafloor bathymetry and ice thickness data through a mass conservation approach. A new 150 m horizontal resolution bed topography/ bathymetric map of Greenland is constructed with seamless transitions at the ice/ocean interface, yielding major improvements over previous data sets, particularly in the marine-terminating sectors of northwest and southeast Greenland. Our map reveals that the total sea level potential of the Greenland ice sheet is 7.42 ± 0.05 m, which is 7 cm greater than previous estimates. Furthermore, it explains recent calving front response of numerous outlet glaciers and reveals new pathways by which AW can access glaciers with marine-based basins, thereby highlighting sectors of Greenland that are most vulnerable to future oceanic forcing.</p>

Understanding the physical processes that drive the Earth&rsquo;s climate system throughout a Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) event remains an important open scientific question in paleoclimate research. The spatial pattern of D-O warming holds clues to the origin of D-O events; whether the critical geographic area is in the Labrador Sea or in the Greenland, Iceland, and Norwegian seas. Ultra-high-resolution stable isotope records from these ice cores document changes in the hydrological cycle associated with these abrupt warming episodes. Climate models show that the southern Dye-3 ice core is more sensitive to abrupt climate change than previously analyzed ice cores, giving the possibility of observing for the first time the temperature imprint of a Heinrich event (a natural phenomenon in which large armadas of icebergs break off from glaciers and traverse the North Atlantic Ocean), as well as the largest D-O warmings ever observed.

The surge of the Bering Bagley Glacier System (BBGS), Alaska, in 2011&ndash;2013 has provided a rare opportunity to study the surge phenomenon in a large and complex glacier system. A surge results in widespread crevassing throughout the glacier system complicating many traditional techniques used to study glacier dynamics. In this paper, we utilize crevassing as a means to investigate the recent BBGS surge through numerical modeling and geostatistical data analysis. Following the principles of structural glaciology, image‐based crevasse characterizations are obtained through geostatistical methods applied to Landsat‐7 data, supplemented by airborne field observations. On the modeling side, a 3‐D full‐Stokes finite element model of the BBGS is developed and applied to investigate ice dynamics and surface structures during the recent surge. A von Mises criterion is adopted to simulate crevassing at the glacier surface, oriented along the axes of maximum principal tensile stress. To facilitate evaluation of model‐ and data‐derived crevasse characteristics, three different comparison methods are introduced. General agreement in the model‐data comparisons indicates that the model has the ability to represent the BBGS system during peak acceleration. The crevasse‐based approach is also employed to optimize the basal sliding parameter and the von Mises stress threshold in the model.

A new 150 m horizontal resolution bed topography/ bathymetric map of Greenland is constructed with seamless transitions at the ice/ocean interface, yielding major improvements over previous data sets, particularly in the marine-terminating sectors of northwest and southeast Greenland. Our map reveals that the total sea level potential of the Greenland ice sheet is 7.42 &plusmn; 0.05 m, which is 7 cm greater than previous estimates. Furthermore, it explains recent calving front response of numerous outlet glaciers and reveals new pathways by which AW can access glaciers with marine-based basins, thereby highlighting sectors of Greenland that are most vulnerable to future oceanic forcing.</p>\r\n<p>Held a<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-419\">GSLCT</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>meeting in October 2017 on wet firn, which included<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\">NASA</abbr>-supported investigators studying firn processes in Greenland and elsewhere.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"9/30/2018","completed":"September 30, 2018","followupvalue":"20180930","id":1866,"users":[],"followup":{"text":["Completed","September 30, 2018"]}},{"milestone":246,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"July 1, 2019","shortdate":"7/1/2019","datevalue":"20190701","action":"<div><span>The&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.iarpccollaborations.org_members_events_12673&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=ApwzowJNAKKw3xye91w7BE1XMRKi2LN9kiMk5Csz9Zk&amp;r=lwDWAU_v_RM7NwCmyK4zCDclC27aay-g6iVBLev0I2E&amp;m=vURjB_M1L4RtHQjJgmbFvpQysvPQBRTif-9m70bCP9c&amp;s=LqrCJ1N_RptkBIPLqv_n2GklES3H9Z-5kVwvqp1-Rfk&amp;e=\">June 25th Atmosphere and Glaciers &amp; Sea Level Collaboration Team &ldquo;Weather and Surface Radiation Balance on the Greenland Ice Sheet&rdquo;</a><span>&nbsp; is relevant to this performance element.&nbsp;</span></div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>The following talks were given:</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span><a href=\"/members/documents/13773\" target=\"_blank\">Greenland climate network 1990 - 2019: Analysis and interpretation</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href=\"/members/people/13755\" target=\"_blank\">Konrad<span>&nbsp;</span>Steffen</a>&nbsp;(Swiss Federal Research Institute<span>&nbsp;</span>WSL)</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span>Koni<span>&nbsp;</span>provided an overview of the Swiss Camp weather station, focusing on observed temperature trends (1991-2019), continuous radiation measurements since 1993, and logistical challenges associated with 12 m of net surface lowering since 1991 due to the expansion of Greenland's ablation area.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Bringing<span>&nbsp;</span>HARMONIE<span>&nbsp;</span>to the Greenland ice sheet: Developing a next generation polar weather and climate model -&nbsp;<a href=\"/members/people/4320\" target=\"_blank\">Ruth<span>&nbsp;</span>Mottram</a>&nbsp;(DMI)\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Ruth described the capabilities of several different weather, climate, and surface mass balance models focusing on<span>&nbsp;</span>HARMONIE, particularly the resolution of fine-scale (0.75 m) topography and assimilation of<span>&nbsp;</span>MODIS<span>&nbsp;</span>data to improve<span>&nbsp;</span>albedo<span>&nbsp;</span>parameterization.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"7/1/2019","completed":"July 1, 2019","followupvalue":"20190701","id":2003,"users":[{"id":3201,"name":"Konrad Steffen","link":"/members/people/13755"},{"id":1020,"name":"Ruth Mottram","link":"/members/people/4320"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","July 1, 2019"]}},{"milestone":246,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"September 16, 2019","shortdate":"9/16/2019","datevalue":"20190916","action":"<p>The National Science Foundation has recently awarded OPP &ndash; 1838410, 1838464.

Investigators will deploy co-located seismic and GPS arrays simultaneously to monitor subglacial meltwater flow and ice surface velocities at a well-studied site on the western margin of the Greenland ice sheet. The team will use co-located measurements of subglacial fluid flow and surface velocities to assess whether seismic tremor can resolve seasonal changes in subglacial hydrology in regions of thick (&ge; 1 km) ice. Specifically, the data will constrain if and when channelization of sub-glacial flow occurs and how characteristics of subglacial channels, such as density and spacing, vary with time. Finally, ice surface velocities will be correlated with sub-glacial channelization to determine whether this process is consistent with existing models for the characteristic seasonal velocity variations observed in this region.

Furthermore, it explains recent calving front response of numerous outlet glaciers and reveals new pathways by which AW can access glaciers with marine-based basins, thereby highlighting sectors of Greenland that are most vulnerable to future oceanic forcing.</p>\r\n<p>Held a<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-419\">GSLCT</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>meeting in October 2017 on wet firn, which included<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\">NASA</abbr>-supported investigators studying firn processes in Greenland and elsewhere.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"10/4/2019","completed":"October 4, 2019","followupvalue":"20191004","id":2254,"users":[{"id":279,"name":"Christine Mataya","link":"/members/people/286"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","October 4, 2019"]}},{"milestone":246,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"October 4, 2019","shortdate":"10/4/2019","datevalue":"20191004","action":"<p><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\" data-hasqtip=\"3\">NASA</abbr>-funded Principal Investigators contributed to this Performance Element as follows:</p>\r\n<p>Lauren Andrews/Goddard Space Flight Center - Physically Based and Stochastic Models for Greenland Moulin Formation, Longevity, and Spatial Distribution - new publication: Poinar, K., Dow, C.

Geophysical Research Letters, 46(9), 4772&ndash;4781. https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GL082786Abstract: The state of the subglacial hydrologic system, which can modify ice motion, is sensitive to the volume and rate of meltwater reaching it. Bare‐ice regions rapidly transport meltwater to the bed via moulins, while in certain accumulation zone regions, meltwater first flows through firn aquifers, which can introduce a substantial delay. We use a subglacial hydrological model forced with idealized meltwater input scenarios to test the effect of this delay on subglacial hydrology. We find that addition of firn‐aquifer water to the subglacial system elevates the inland subglacial water pressure while reducing water pressure and enhancing subglacial channelization near the terminus. This effect dampens seasonal variations in subglacial water pressure and may explain regionally anomalous ice velocity patterns observed in Southeast Greenland. As surface melt rates increase and firn aquifers expand inland, it is crucial to understand how inland drainage of meltwater affects the evolution of the subglacial hydrologic system.</p>\r\n<p>Ellyn Enderlin/University of Maine, Orono - Quantification and Analysis of Greenland Glacier and Ice Cap Discharge using Automated Landsat Terminus Change Time Series and<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\">NASA</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>Data Products - no publications yet, but results should be shared in 2020.

Seasonal to decadal variability in ice discharge from the Greenland Ice Sheet. The Cryosphere 12, 3813-3825, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3813-2018Abstract: Rapid changes in thickness and velocity have been observed at many marine-terminating glaciers in Greenland, impacting the volume of ice they export, or discharge, from the ice sheet. While annual estimates of ice-sheet-wide discharge have been previously derived, higher-resolution records are required to fully constrain the temporal response of these glaciers to various climatic and mechanical drivers that vary in sub-annual scales. Here we sample outlet glaciers wider than 1&thinsp;km (N=230) to derive the first continuous, ice-sheet-wide record of total ice sheet discharge for the 2000&ndash;2016 period, resolving a seasonal variability of 6&thinsp;%. The amplitude of seasonality varies spatially across the ice sheet from 5&thinsp;% in the southeastern region to 9&thinsp;% in the northwest region. We analyze seasonal to annual variability in the discharge time series with respect to both modeled meltwater runoff, obtained from RACMO2.3p2, and glacier front position changes over the same period. We find that year-to-year changes in total ice sheet discharge are related to annual front changes (r2=0.59, p=10&minus;4) and that the annual magnitude of discharge is closely related to cumulative front position changes (r2=0.79), which show a net retreat of &gt;400&thinsp;km, or an average retreat of &gt;2&thinsp;km, at each surveyed glacier. Neither maximum seasonal runoff or annual runoff totals are correlated to annual discharge, which suggests that larger annual quantities of runoff do not relate to increased annual discharge. Discharge and runoff, however, follow similar patterns of seasonal variability with near-coincident periods of acceleration and seasonal maxima. These results suggest that changes in glacier front position drive secular trends in discharge, whereas the impact of runoff is likely limited to the summer months when observed seasonal variations are substantially controlled by the timing of meltwater input.</p>\r\n<p>Lora Koenig/University of Colorado, Boulder - Constraining Aquifer Formation and Expansion in Greenland Using Enhanced Resolution Brightness Temperatures - no publications yet, but results should be shared in 2020.

The Greenland Ice Sheet&rsquo;s contribution to sea-level rise is accelerating, partly due to the acceleration of ice-sheet flow. Melt from the ice-sheet surface can reach the base of the ice and change ice flow. AS the climate warms and the area of the ice surface undergoing surface melting expands inland, important questions include whether a larger area of the ice-sheet bed will receive injections of meltwater, and whether this will lead to faster flow. In this project, Global Positioning System (GPS) and autonomous phase-sensitive radar units will be deployed over a 16-month period to measure ice-sheet surface velocity, surface and englacial strain, and stress transients around supraglacial lakes and moulins in the mid- to upper-ablation zone. These field data will be used in conjunction with geophysical inverse modeling techniques to compute surface and englacial stress and deformation patterns and to quantify the processes controlling water access to the ice-sheet bed. A major goal of the research is to address fundamental questions that will move us towards being able to describe the dynamic impact of surface-to-bed meltwater transit in prognostic ice-sheet models for both the Greenland Ice Sheet and Antarctic Ice Sheet. Combining observations of englacial strain and surface deformation has the potential to transform understanding of ice-sheet deformation, by allowing an empirical test of the assumption that an elastic model is appropriate for inverting observations of surface deformation of glacial ice on short timescales.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"8/21/2020","completed":"August 21, 2020","followupvalue":"20200821","id":2464,"users":[{"id":1080,"name":"Kate Ruck","link":"/members/people/4560"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","August 21, 2020"]}},{"milestone":246,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"September 3, 2020","shortdate":"9/3/2020","datevalue":"20200903","action":"<p>The National Science Foundation has recently awarded OPP &ndash; 2023674, 2023269, 2023319. Existing theory suggests that the rate of submarine melting along the ice-ocean interface of marine-terminating glaciers is set by the strength of subglacial discharge. However, recent observations find unexpectedly high melt rates over broad sections of glacier termini. The observed order of magnitude discrepancies between observed and predicted melt rates suggests the presence of energetic dynamics elsewhere along the ice face that drive near-ice turbulent flows. This project hypothesizes that this discrepancy arises from differences in the rate-controlling physics within the boundary layers. The goal is to develop a network of coordinated underwater acoustic, optical and in-situ unmanned sensors to be deployed at LeConte Glacier, Alaska. Using methods that meld glaciology, oceanography, and robotics, these systems will collect the first geophysical observations of the turbulent boundary layer at a near-vertical glacier face. Specifically, they will directly measure velocity, salinity and temperature through a buoyancy-forced near-vertical boundary layer and relate these to observations of the subsurface ice morphology (e.g., slope, roughness) across several spatial scales. By combining these data with high-resolution realistic simulations, they will characterize the dominant contributions to boundary layer turbulence and explicitly relate these to local melt rates. The ultimate goal is to determine what parameters need to be measured over what time and space scales, as well as what assumptions can be made in order to connect dynamics from the small-scale ice interface to the large-scale ocean and glacier forcing.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"9/3/2020","completed":"September 3, 2020","followupvalue":"20200903","id":2488,"users":[{"id":1080,"name":"Kate Ruck","link":"/members/people/4560"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","September 3, 2020"]}},{"milestone":246,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"September 3, 2020","shortdate":"9/3/2020","datevalue":"20200903","action":"<p>The National Science Foundation has recently awarded OPP &ndash; 1954006, 1954021.

The project will collect in-situ seismic, radar, geodetic, meteorological, and time-lapse imagery of hydrologic and glacier dynamics instabilities occurring throughout the upcoming surge of Turner Glacier in SE Alaska. The team will combine in-situ observations with satellite-derived glacier velocity, elevation, terminus position, and subglacial plume data to map meltwater routing beneath the glacier during the initiation, propagation, and termination of the surge. These data will be paired with a state-of-the-art hydrologic numerical modeling to investigate the evolution of the controls on the hydrologic and dynamic glacier instabilities throughout the full surge. The dataset, coupled with modern models, will yield improved, process-based understanding what controls the initiation, propagation, and termination of glacier surges.

Observational datasets of Greenland Ice Sheet change are rapidly expanding and have been used for calibration and validation of ice sheet models. But substantial data-model gaps remain due to the knowledge barrier of understanding and using satellite- and paleo-data and the lack of a standard framework for using available observational datasets in ice sheet modeling experiments. There is significant potential to generate a long-lasting cyberinfrastructure framework with ice sheet data, software tools, online cloud-based execution and educational materials. When combined, this would lead to rapid progress in improving ice sheet modeling capability and decreasing uncertainty in sea level rise forecasting. The PIs will bring together experts in ice sheet observation, data analysis and modeling to guide the creation of a community hub that will enable two-way communication between data generators and modelers. The PIs will pilot software tools necessary to facilitate interoperability among the various data sets and modeling tools and investigate new metrics for model-data intercomparison and model assessment.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"9/25/2018","completed":"September 25, 2018","followupvalue":"20180925","id":1706,"users":[{"id":1080,"name":"Kate Ruck","link":"/members/people/4560"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","September 25, 2018"]}},{"milestone":203,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"September 30, 2018","shortdate":"9/30/2018","datevalue":"20180930","action":"<p><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\" data-hasqtip=\"2\">NASA</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>contributed to this PE in the following ways:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Operation IceBridge (OIB) underflew 345 NM of<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-94\">ESA</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>Sentinel-3A and 233 NM of<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-94\" data-hasqtip=\"1\">ESA</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>CryoSat-2 tracks during its 2018 Arctic spring campaign.

The project is deploying new data assimilation capabilities to best integrate&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&amp;nbsp;&lt;/abbr&gt;satellite data as well as in-situ data into reconstructions and projections of the state of the Cryosphere. Efforts are helping to understand interactions between the Cryosphere and other components of the Earth System, in particular ice/ocean and ice/atmosphere interactions, to better constrain projections of the contribution of ice sheets to future sea-level. Most recently, the team added high-resolution sea-level fingerprint computation capabilities to ISSM in order to compute localized sea-level changes in Greenland&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, this year&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;&amp;rsquo;s Physical Oceanography Principal Investigators Eyre and Zeng (2017) evaluated five surface air temperature data sets, including that of the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-360&quot;&gt;MERRA&lt;/abbr&gt;-2&amp;rdquo; reanalysis. The paper found that the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-360&quot;&gt;MERRA&lt;/abbr&gt;-2 reanalysis performed better than the other data sets, with a mean absolute error less than 2 degrees Celsius in all months. It also showed that this bias is much lower than the 31 Earth system model runs from the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-64&quot;&gt;CMIP5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;archive, which reach approximately 5 degrees Celsius for the 1901 &amp;ndash; 2000 average bias. This shows the value of data assimilation for providing comprehensive, observation-constrained estimates of important cryospheric properties. The reference and abstract for the paper follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near-surface air temperature (SAT) over Greenland has important effects on mass balance of the ice sheet, but it is unclear which SAT datasets are reliable in the region. Here extensive in&amp;nbsp;situ SAT measurements ( &amp;sim; 1400 station-years) are used to assess monthly mean SAT from seven global reanalysis datasets, five gridded SAT analyses, one satellite retrieval and three dynamically downscaled reanalyses. Strengths and weaknesses of these products are identified, and their biases are found to vary by season and glaciological regime. MERRA2 reanalysis overall performs best with mean absolute error less than 2&amp;deg;C in all months. Ice sheet-average annual mean SAT from different datasets are highly correlated in recent decades, but their 1901&amp;ndash;2000 trends differ even in sign. Compared with the MERRA2 climatology combined with gridded SAT analysis anomalies, thirty-one earth system model historical runs from the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-64&quot;&gt;CMIP5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;archive reach &amp;sim; 5&amp;deg;C for the 1901&amp;ndash;2000 average bias and have opposite trends for a number of sub-periods.&lt;/p&gt;

Understanding the physical processes that drive the Earth&rsquo;s climate system throughout a Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) event remains an important open scientific question in paleoclimate research. The spatial pattern of D-O warming holds clues to the origin of D-O events; whether the critical geographic area is in the Labrador Sea or in the Greenland, Iceland, and Norwegian seas. Ultra-high-resolution stable isotope records from these ice cores document changes in the hydrological cycle associated with these abrupt warming episodes. Climate models show that the southern Dye-3 ice core is more sensitive to abrupt climate change than previously analyzed ice cores, giving the possibility of observing for the first time the temperature imprint of a Heinrich event (a natural phenomenon in which large armadas of icebergs break off from glaciers and traverse the North Atlantic Ocean), as well as the largest D-O warmings ever observed.

There is significant potential to generate a long-lasting cyberinfrastructure framework with ice sheet data, software tools, online cloud-based execution and educational materials. When combined, this would lead to rapid progress in improving ice sheet modeling capability and decreasing uncertainty in sea level rise forecasting. The PIs will bring together experts in ice sheet observation, data analysis and modeling to guide the creation of a community hub that will enable two-way communication between data generators and modelers.

The paper found that the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-360\">MERRA</abbr>-2 reanalysis performed better than the other data sets, with a mean absolute error less than 2 degrees Celsius in all months. It also showed that this bias is much lower than the 31 Earth system model runs from the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-64\">CMIP5</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>archive, which reach approximately 5 degrees Celsius for the 1901 &ndash; 2000 average bias. This shows the value of data assimilation for providing comprehensive, observation-constrained estimates of important cryospheric properties.

Here extensive in&nbsp;situ SAT measurements ( &sim; 1400 station-years) are used to assess monthly mean SAT from seven global reanalysis datasets, five gridded SAT analyses, one satellite retrieval and three dynamically downscaled reanalyses. Strengths and weaknesses of these products are identified, and their biases are found to vary by season and glaciological regime. MERRA2 reanalysis overall performs best with mean absolute error less than 2&deg;C in all months. Ice sheet-average annual mean SAT from different datasets are highly correlated in recent decades, but their 1901&ndash;2000 trends differ even in sign.

Y. : Quantification of Surface Forcing Requirements for a Greenland Ice Sheet Model Using Uncertainty Analyses, GRL, 46, 2019, https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GL083532 <br />Abstract: The Greenland Ice Sheet is a substantial reservoir of almost 7 m of sea level equivalent, and on average, climate dictates 60% of its sea level contribution. Changes in ice discharge, driven by perturbations in outlet glacier ice dynamics, constitute the rest. Climate also affects ice discharge, since the flow of interior ice feeding the outlet glaciers evolves in response to surface changes over time. Here, using an ice sheet model and uncertainty quantification, we explore ice flow sensitivity to climate‐driven changes in ice surface topography on multidecadal timescales. We find that changes in surface forcing near large outlet glaciers can influence region‐wide ice flow. Improvements to climate products should be prioritized in these areas, especially in the Central West and Southeast. Results also suggest that over most of Greenland, surface forcing should be supplied at a spatial resolution of 21 km or finer to accurately simulate ice response to climate change.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"","completed":"","followupvalue":"","id":2145,"users":[],"followup":null},{"milestone":286,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"October 4, 2019","shortdate":"10/4/2019","datevalue":"20191004","action":"<p><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\">NASA</abbr><span>'s&nbsp;additional input:&nbsp;Preparations for<span>&nbsp;</span></span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-429\">ISMIP6</abbr><span><span>&nbsp;</span>continued with a planning workshop in the Netherlands in September 2018, followed by a pre-</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-21\">AGU</abbr><span><span>&nbsp;</span>meeting in Washington in December.

<p>This update is also listed in 9.3.6:</p>
<p>&nbsp;The<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-429">ISMIP6</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>project includes participation from<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-155">NASA</abbr>-sponsored models including ISSM developed at JPL and PISM, which is being utilized with the GISS ModelE earth system model. An overview of initialization and model protocols in support of<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-429">ISMIP6</abbr>for the Greenland Ice Sheet has been presented in a recent publication (Goelzer et al., 2018). The paper summarizes initMIP-Greenland, a comparison of ice sheet initialization procedures for the present day for centennial scale prognostic sea level change projections. Corresponding simulations for initMIP-Antarctica have been conducted and are being evaluated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An additional pre-<abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-429">ISMIP6</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>study has been organized to examine the simulated influence of ice shelves in retaining grounded ice mass. This study is known as ABUMIP, the Antarctic BUttressing Model Intercomparison Project. The scope of the experiments for ABUMIP have been outlined, and simulations were completed on 1-May 2018.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-429">ISMIP6</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>workshop was held prior to the annual<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-21">AGU</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>meeting on 10-December 2017 in New Orleans to review the progress towards<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-429">ISMIP6</abbr>.</p>
<p>At this meeting, the results of initMIP-Greenland and initMIP-Antarctic experiments were presented, and model protocol for<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-429">ISMIP6</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>was discussed.</p>
<p>There was additional participation at the workshop by atmospheric and oceanic modeling communities for the purpose of understanding issues and uncertainties regarding boundary conditions and model coupling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two focus groups have been organized to explore options for forcing ice sheet models in<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-429" data-hasqtip="2">ISMIP6</abbr>. The atmospheric focus group is led by William Lipscomb (<abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-252">NCAR</abbr>), and the oceanic forcing group is led by Fiamma Straneo (Scripps Inst. Oceanogr.). The focus groups have held telecons throughout the summer 2018 to address their respective topics and will make presentions on findings at the upcoming<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-429">ISMIP6</abbr>workshop in September 2018.</p>

Large uncertainties in future sea level rise (SLR) predictions is due, in part, to insufficient measurements of bedrock topography and surface crevasses used in ice sheet models in the most critical regions of the ice sheets. This project addresses the data need by equipping a small drone helicopter with a radar suite to produce fine-grid measurements of ice thickness, bed topography, and crevasses in critical regions of the ice sheet. The primary technological research goal is to extend the application of drones in environmental remote sensing by: 1) using a novel approach for antenna integration and multi-pass distributed array processing that overcomes major payload limitations of small drones, and 2) demonstrating an autonomous platform that is easier to operate yet has sufficient payload capabilities and is robust enough to conduct measurements in polar environments. The vehicle&rsquo;s flight capabilities will enable crevasse mapping and bed topography data collection with a combined spatial extent and resolution that will allow scientists to study: 1) the effects of measurement resolution on modeling ice sheet dynamic processes; 2) the significance of bed topography on glacial behavior at multiple time scales; and, 3) crevassing mechanisms and correlating crevasse attributes to calving events.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"9/16/2019","completed":"September 16, 2019","followupvalue":"20190916","id":2086,"users":[{"id":1080,"name":"Kate Ruck","link":"/members/people/4560"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","September 16, 2019"]}},{"milestone":179,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"September 24, 2019","shortdate":"9/24/2019","datevalue":"20190924","action":"<p>The National Science Foundation has recently awarded OPP &ndash; 1903596. The Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) has emerged as a significant contributor to present-day, and possibly future global sea level rise. Predictions of mass loss over the coming century have been hampered by large discord between current-generation ice sheet models. Major challenges are the lack of suitable observational constraints for model calibration and accurate histories of past surface climates that may serve as surface forcing boundary conditions in ice sheet model simulations. This project addresses these challenges using observational data in the form of stratigraphic horizons of constant age that have been imaged by numerous ice-penetrating radar surveys, which serve as a data-constraints on the past flow and boundary conditions of an ice sheet model. The method developed will provide a novel approach for rigorous ice sheet calibration and initialization.

We find that Greenland could contribute 5 to 33 cm to sea level by 2100, with discharge from outlet glaciers contributing 8 to 45% of total mass loss. Our analysis shows that uncertainties in projecting mass loss are dominated by uncertainties in climate scenarios and surface processes, whereas uncertainties in calving and frontal melt play a minor role.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abstract is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing melt over the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) recorded over the past several years has resulted in significant changes of the percolation regime of the ice sheet. It remains unclear whether Greenland&amp;rsquo;s percolation zone will act as a meltwater buffer in the near future through gradually filling all pore space or if near-surface refreezing causes the formation of impermeable layers, which provoke lateral runoff. Homogeneous ice layers within perennial firn, as well as near-surface ice layers of several meter thickness have been observed in firn cores. Because firn coring is a destructive method, deriving stratigraphic changes in firn and allocation of summer melt events is challenging. To overcome this deficit and provide continuous data for model evaluations on snow and firn density, temporal changes in liquid water content and depths of water infiltration, we installed an upwardlooking radar system (upGPR) 3.4m below the snow surface in May 2016 close to Camp Raven (66.4779 N, 46.2856 W) at 2120ma.s.l. The radar is capable of quasi-continuously monitoring changes in snow and firn stratigraphy, which occur above the antennas. For summer 2016, we observed four major melt events, which routed liquid water into various depths beneath the surface. The last event in mid-August resulted in the deepest percolation down to about 2.3m beneath the surface. Comparisons with simulations from the regional climate model MAR are in very good agreement in terms of seasonal changes in accumulation and timing of onset of melt. However, neither bulk density of near-surface layers nor the amounts of liquid water and percolation depths predicted by MAR correspond with upGPR data. Radar data and records of a nearby thermistor string, in contrast, matched very well for both timing and depth of temperature changes and observed water percolations. All four melt events transferred a cumulative mass of 56 kgm􀀀2 into firn beneath the summer surface of 2015. We find that continuous observations of liquid water content, percolation depths and rates for the seasonal mass fluxes are sufficiently accurate to provide valuable information for validation of model approaches and help to develop a better understanding of liquid water retention and percolation in perennial firn.&lt;/p&gt;

This solicitation supported investigations that use remote sensing to study the land-based ice sheets and sea ice. Supported studies are based on satellite and aircraft remote sensing observations and seek to understand the factors controlling changes in the ice and its interaction with the ocean, atmosphere, solid Earth, and solar radiation. The following new projects will be reported on in the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;

The overarching goal of NEWS investigations is to integrate Earth Science Research Program components to make decisive progress toward the NEWS challenge. To achieve this objective, the NEWS investigations will integrate and interpret past, current, and future space based and in situ observations into assimilation and prediction products and models that are global in scope. These activities will serve efforts to improve understanding, modeling, and information for global prediction systems. To achieve these goals, the NEWS investigations must recognize that accurate prediction of not only trends in the mean, but also extremes and abrupt changes, is a key step toward useful applications. The critical feedbacks within the overall NEWS strategy are the lessons that scientific analysis, modeling, prediction, and consequences can guide and identify the technological and observational requirements of future&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;missions.&lt;/p&gt;" data-action-deadline="" data-action-completed="9/30/2018" data-action-contacts="[{&quot;id&quot;:279,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Christine Mataya&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:&quot;/members/people/286&quot;}]">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The abstract is as follows:</p>
<p>Increasing melt over the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) recorded over the past several years has resulted in significant changes of the percolation regime of the ice sheet. It remains unclear whether Greenland’s percolation zone will act as a meltwater buffer in the near future through gradually filling all pore space or if near-surface refreezing causes the formation of impermeable layers, which provoke lateral runoff. Homogeneous ice layers within perennial firn, as well as near-surface ice layers of several meter thickness have been observed in firn cores. Because firn coring is a destructive method, deriving stratigraphic changes in firn and allocation of summer melt events is challenging. To overcome this deficit and provide continuous data for model evaluations on snow and firn density, temporal changes in liquid water content and depths of water infiltration, we installed an upwardlooking radar system (upGPR) 3.4m below the snow surface in May 2016 close to Camp Raven (66.4779 N, 46.2856 W) at 2120ma.s.l. The radar is capable of quasi-continuously monitoring changes in snow and firn stratigraphy, which occur above the antennas. For summer 2016, we observed four major melt events, which routed liquid water into various depths beneath the surface. The last event in mid-August resulted in the deepest percolation down to about 2.3m beneath the surface. Comparisons with simulations from the regional climate model MAR are in very good agreement in terms of seasonal changes in accumulation and timing of onset of melt. However, neither bulk density of near-surface layers nor the amounts of liquid water and percolation depths predicted by MAR correspond with upGPR data. Radar data and records of a nearby thermistor string, in contrast, matched very well for both timing and depth of temperature changes and observed water percolations. All four melt events transferred a cumulative mass of 56 kgm􀀀2 into firn beneath the summer surface of 2015. We find that continuous observations of liquid water content, percolation depths and rates for the seasonal mass fluxes are sufficiently accurate to provide valuable information for validation of model approaches and help to develop a better understanding of liquid water retention and percolation in perennial firn.</p>

This solicitation supported investigations that use remote sensing to study the land-based ice sheets and sea ice. Supported studies are based on satellite and aircraft remote sensing observations and seek to understand the factors controlling changes in the ice and its interaction with the ocean, atmosphere, solid Earth, and solar radiation. The following new projects will be reported on in the coming year.</p>

The overarching goal of NEWS investigations is to integrate Earth Science Research Program components to make decisive progress toward the NEWS challenge. To achieve this objective, the NEWS investigations will integrate and interpret past, current, and future space based and in situ observations into assimilation and prediction products and models that are global in scope. These activities will serve efforts to improve understanding, modeling, and information for global prediction systems. To achieve these goals, the NEWS investigations must recognize that accurate prediction of not only trends in the mean, but also extremes and abrupt changes, is a key step toward useful applications. The critical feedbacks within the overall NEWS strategy are the lessons that scientific analysis, modeling, prediction, and consequences can guide and identify the technological and observational requirements of future<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-155">NASA</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>missions.</p><p></p>

They will collect borehole inclinometry and water pressure, glacier surface velocity, radar-based ice thickness, and hydrometeorological data, among other field-based and remotely sensed observations. They will also use a numerical glacier flow model to interpret these data. This focus will allow researchers to extend insight gained at Athabasca Glacier to the rest of the world&rsquo;s warm-bedded glaciers.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"9/25/2018","completed":"September 25, 2018","followupvalue":"20180925","id":1704,"users":[{"id":1080,"name":"Kate Ruck","link":"/members/people/4560"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","September 25, 2018"]}},{"milestone":193,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"September 25, 2018","shortdate":"9/25/2018","datevalue":"20180925","action":"<p>The National Science Foundation has recently awarded OPP &ndash; 1837544.

It remains unclear whether Greenland&rsquo;s percolation zone will act as a meltwater buffer in the near future through gradually filling all pore space or if near-surface refreezing causes the formation of impermeable layers, which provoke lateral runoff. Homogeneous ice layers within perennial firn, as well as near-surface ice layers of several meter thickness have been observed in firn cores. Because firn coring is a destructive method, deriving stratigraphic changes in firn and allocation of summer melt events is challenging. To overcome this deficit and provide continuous data for model evaluations on snow and firn density, temporal changes in liquid water content and depths of water infiltration, we installed an upwardlooking radar system (upGPR) 3.4m below the snow surface in May 2016 close to Camp Raven (66.4779 N, 46.2856 W) at 2120ma.s.l. The radar is capable of quasi-continuously monitoring changes in snow and firn stratigraphy, which occur above the antennas. For summer 2016, we observed four major melt events, which routed liquid water into various depths beneath the surface. The last event in mid-August resulted in the deepest percolation down to about 2.3m beneath the surface. Comparisons with simulations from the regional climate model MAR are in very good agreement in terms of seasonal changes in accumulation and timing of onset of melt. However, neither bulk density of near-surface layers nor the amounts of liquid water and percolation depths predicted by MAR correspond with upGPR data. Radar data and records of a nearby thermistor string, in contrast, matched very well for both timing and depth of temperature changes and observed water percolations. All four melt events transferred a cumulative mass of 56 kgm􀀀2 into firn beneath the summer surface of 2015. We find that continuous observations of liquid water content, percolation depths and rates for the seasonal mass fluxes are sufficiently accurate to provide valuable information for validation of model approaches and help to develop a better understanding of liquid water retention and percolation in perennial firn.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\">NASA</abbr>&rsquo;s<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-199\">ROSES</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>2017 element A.16 Cryospheric Science solicitation selected 16 proposals in spring 2018.

Current ice margin recession is led by the retreat of outlet glaciers, large rivers of ice ending in narrow fjords that drain the interior. We pair an outlet glacier&ndash;resolving ice sheet model with a comprehensive uncertainty quantification to estimate Greenland&rsquo;s contribution to sea level over the next millennium. We find that Greenland could contribute 5 to 33 cm to sea level by 2100, with discharge from outlet glaciers contributing 8 to 45% of total mass loss. Our analysis shows that uncertainties in projecting mass loss are dominated by uncertainties in climate scenarios and surface processes, whereas uncertainties in calving and frontal melt play a minor role. We project that Greenland will very likely become ice free within a millennium without substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.</p>\r\n<p>Lauren Andrews/Goddard Space Flight Center - Physically Based and Stochastic Models for Greenland Moulin Formation, Longevity, and Spatial Distribution:Poinar, K., Dow, C. F., &amp; Andrews, L. C. (2019). Long-Term Support of an Active Subglacial Hydrologic System in Southeast Greenland by Firn Aquifers. Geophysical Research Letters, 46(9), 4772&ndash;4781. https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GL082786Abstract: The state of the subglacial hydrologic system, which can modify ice motion, is sensitive to the volume and rate of meltwater reaching it. Bare‐ice regions rapidly transport meltwater to the bed via moulins, while in certain accumulation zone regions, meltwater first flows through firn aquifers, which can introduce a substantial delay. We use a subglacial hydrological model forced with idealized meltwater input scenarios to test the effect of this delay on subglacial hydrology. We find that addition of firn‐aquifer water to the subglacial system elevates the inland subglacial water pressure while reducing water pressure and enhancing subglacial channelization near the terminus. This effect dampens seasonal variations in subglacial water pressure and may explain regionally anomalous ice velocity patterns observed in Southeast Greenland. As surface melt rates increase and firn aquifers expand inland, it is crucial to understand how inland drainage of meltwater affects the evolution of the subglacial hydrologic system.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"10/4/2019","completed":"October 4, 2019","followupvalue":"20191004","id":2259,"users":[{"id":279,"name":"Christine Mataya","link":"/members/people/286"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","October 4, 2019"]}},{"milestone":193,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"May 21, 2020","shortdate":"5/21/2020","datevalue":"20200521","action":"<p><span><a href=\"/members/events/15943\"><strong>Glaciers &amp; Sea Level April 9th Meeting</strong></a><strong><span>&nbsp;</span>(</strong><a href=\"/members/documents/16600\"><strong>Agenda</strong></a><strong>,<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><a href=\"/members/events/15943\"><strong>Notes and Recording</strong></a><strong>)</strong></span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em><span>Topic:<span>&nbsp;</span></span></em><span>Modeling ALL the glaciers: Global glacier modeling</span></li>\r\n<li><em>Presentations:</em>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span><a href=\"/members/documents/16676\">GlacierMIP<span>&nbsp;</span>- A model<span>&nbsp;</span>intercomparison<span>&nbsp;</span>of global-scale glacier mass balance models and projections</a>-<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"/members/people/2487\">Regine<span>&nbsp;</span>Hock</a><span>&nbsp;</span>(<abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-230\">UAF</abbr>)</span></li>\r\n<li><span><a href=\"/members/documents/16667\">The Open Global Glacier Model: a modern, modular and extensible framework for large scale glacier modeling</a>-<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"/members/people/10017\">Fabien<span>&nbsp;</span>Maussion</a><span>&nbsp;</span>(University of Innsbruck)</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><em><span>Highlights:&nbsp;</span></em>Regine<span>&nbsp;</span>described<span>&nbsp;</span>GlacierMIP, which targets all glaciers in the works outside the ice sheets (about 40cm in sea level equivalent) and shared some results.<span>&nbsp;</span>Fabien<span>&nbsp;</span>described the components of open-source data and its process.

Existing theory suggests that the rate of submarine melting along the ice-ocean interface of marine-terminating glaciers is set by the strength of subglacial discharge. However, recent observations find unexpectedly high melt rates over broad sections of glacier termini. The observed order of magnitude discrepancies between observed and predicted melt rates suggests the presence of energetic dynamics elsewhere along the ice face that drive near-ice turbulent flows. This project hypothesizes that this discrepancy arises from differences in the rate-controlling physics within the boundary layers. The goal is to develop a network of coordinated underwater acoustic, optical and in-situ unmanned sensors to be deployed at LeConte Glacier, Alaska. Using methods that meld glaciology, oceanography, and robotics, these systems will collect the first geophysical observations of the turbulent boundary layer at a near-vertical glacier face. Specifically, they will directly measure velocity, salinity and temperature through a buoyancy-forced near-vertical boundary layer and relate these to observations of the subsurface ice morphology (e.g., slope, roughness) across several spatial scales. By combining these data with high-resolution realistic simulations, they will characterize the dominant contributions to boundary layer turbulence and explicitly relate these to local melt rates. The ultimate goal is to determine what parameters need to be measured over what time and space scales, as well as what assumptions can be made in order to connect dynamics from the small-scale ice interface to the large-scale ocean and glacier forcing.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"9/3/2020","completed":"September 3, 2020","followupvalue":"20200903","id":2489,"users":[{"id":1080,"name":"Kate Ruck","link":"/members/people/4560"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","September 3, 2020"]}},{"milestone":193,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"September 3, 2020","shortdate":"9/3/2020","datevalue":"20200903","action":"<p>The National Science Foundation has recently awarded OPP &ndash; 1954006, 1954021.
