Food security, in particular for Alaska coastal communities but also in the context of large-scale fisheries and other factors of national concern has been substantially impacted by changing ice and ocean conditions that have been most pronounced in the Pacific Arctic sector in recent years. The project draws on different assessment, modeling, and observing system design approaches to lay the foundation for a food-security oriented information product integrating different types of coordinated observations. In accomplishing project goals, Alaska Native scholars are active participants in the work, with a focus on capacity-building within Indigenous Peoples’ organizations such that they can better steer and utilize Arctic observing data and information products.</p><p></p>

Sandy reviewed the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;/members/documents/12920&quot;&gt;meeting summary&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and discussed next steps. The main activity of the working group is to provide recommendations for a roadmap for future Arctic observational capacities. The roadmap is intended to help decision makers understand critical observational needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hajo Eicken, on behalf of Craig Lee, explained that a community white paper is being developed in support of sustained Arctic ocean system observing for decadal OceanObs 2019 meeting which will be held in mid-September. The Arctic paper being developed lays out the central challenges to Arctic Ocean observing and suggests different approaches. The paper intends to link what we need to know to specific observations. The development of the paper is ongoing and those interested in this topic should connect with Hajo Eicken or Craig Lee.&lt;/li&gt;

The pre-science forum fed into the science forum, which fed into the ministerial. There was a tension between continuing planning efforts and moving toward implementation. The key component of the ministerial was that there was remarkable uniformity on what is needed and the importance of the Arctic. The joint statement is quite powerful and can be used to push for moving ahead with Arctic observations.&lt;/li&gt;

Project objectives are achieved by tying into key goals identified by the Arctic Council&rsquo;s and International Arctic Science Committee&rsquo;s Sustaining Arctic Observing Networks (SAON) initiative. Specifically, the international community has developed a joint vision for a connected, collaborative, and comprehensive long-term pan-Arctic Observing System that serves societal needs. The project transforms the Arctic Observing Summit (AOS) from a biennial meeting into an ongoing process and resource to aid with coordination of observations. Food security, in particular for Alaska coastal communities but also in the context of large-scale fisheries and other factors of national concern has been substantially impacted by changing ice and ocean conditions that have been most pronounced in the Pacific Arctic sector in recent years. The project draws on different assessment, modeling, and observing system design approaches to lay the foundation for a food-security oriented information product integrating different types of coordinated observations. In accomplishing project goals, Alaska Native scholars are active participants in the work, with a focus on capacity-building within Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; organizations such that they can better steer and utilize Arctic observing data and information products.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"8/21/2020","completed":"August 21, 2020","followupvalue":"20200821","id":2457,"users":[{"id":1080,"name":"Kate Ruck","link":"/members/people/4560"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","August 21, 2020"]}},{"milestone":253,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"October 30, 2020","shortdate":"10/30/2020","datevalue":"20201030","action":"<p><span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Arctic Observing Summit 2020 statement and AOS input to 3rd Arctic Science Ministerial have been released&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:1053569,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;10&quot;:2,&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;23&quot;:1}\" data-sheets-textstyleruns=\"[null,0,{&quot;2&quot;:[null,2,1136076],&quot;9&quot;:1}]{&quot;1&quot;:38}\" data-sheets-hyperlinkruns=\"[null,0,&quot;https://arcticobservingsummit.org/aos-2020-conference-statement-0&quot;]{&quot;1&quot;:38}\"><span><a class=\"in-cell-link\" href=\"https://arcticobservingsummit.org/aos-2020-conference-statement-0\" target=\"_blank\">Arctic Observing Summit 2020 statement</a></span><span>&nbsp;and AOS input to 3rd Arctic Science Ministerial have been released</span></span></p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"10/30/2020","completed":"October 30, 2020","followupvalue":"20201030","id":2555,"users":[{"id":384,"name":"Hajo Eicken","link":"/members/people/986"},{"id":3093,"name":"Kelley Uhlig","link":"/members/people/13021"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","October 30, 2020"]}},{"milestone":253,"editable":false,"type":"outstanding","typeclass":"outstanding","date":"November 13, 2020","shortdate":"11/13/2020","datevalue":"20201113","action":"<p><span><a class=\"in-cell-link\" href=\"https://arcticobservingsummit.org/aos-2020-white-papers-and-short-statements\" target=\"_blank\">Arctic Observing Summit&nbsp;whitepapers</a></span><span>&nbsp;are available, with subset of papers being transformed into contributions for special issue of ARCTIC, to be released prior to&nbsp;ASM-3 in May 2021;&nbsp;AOS&nbsp;2020 Summary Report in development.</span></p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"","completed":"","followupvalue":"","id":2560,"users":[{"id":384,"name":"Hajo Eicken","link":"/members/people/986"},{"id":3093,"name":"Kelley Uhlig","link":"/members/people/13021"}],"followup":null},{"milestone":253,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"May 13, 2020","shortdate":"5/13/2020","datevalue":"20200513","action":"<p><span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;US whitepaper contributions to AOS summarized and presented to the AOSST team during the March 2020 meeting.

Under this USArray project, 192 multi-sensor platforms were built across Alaska and northwestern Canada.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Words from Nikoosh Carlo: The Arctic Futures 2050 conference was is step in creating opportunities for stronger exchanges and honest dialogue moving forward. Spending time and effort in developing personal relationships in smaller groups and using a different type of space to get to that place where you have strong exchanges of information. Resources were an important topic and often determine power. How do you draw from different sources? How do you use these revenue streams to support communities? How can institutions and frameworks that are already existing be changed or adjusted so there is greater participation from indigenous representatives?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Words from Deenaalee Hodgon: Need more young voices invited and part of the discussion. Arctic Youth Ambassadors could be included more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Where were the policy makers? This is somewhere we could grow more. A good part of Arctic Futures were the spaces where Indigenous Peoples were able to speak about issues in frank and unguarded way among themselves. Still grappling with issues around wellness, voices, and agency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Highlights:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>The<span>&nbsp;</span>US sponsors a diversity of efforts to advance Arctic observing and data systems and to enhance their derived value. A national interface is needed to draw these efforts into closer coordination and coherence and to maximize their impact at the international level. The US Arctic Observing Network (US<span>&nbsp;</span>AON) serves as this interface nationally and one of its responsibilities is convening a quarterly joint meeting of the<span>&nbsp;</span>IARPCCollaborations<span>&nbsp;</span>Observing and Data teams. This quarterly call focused on efforts to advance the work of<span>&nbsp;</span>SAON<span>&nbsp;</span>(Sustaining Arctic Observing Networks), the Arctic Observing Summit, and other<span>&nbsp;</span>multi-national regional and global efforts.</p><p></p>

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sandy spoke about the evolution of the&amp;nbsp;AOS-SAON&amp;nbsp;working group on Optimization and Implementation since the Arctic Observing Summit last summer. Sandy reviewed the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;/members/documents/12920&quot;&gt;meeting summary&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and discussed next steps. The main activity of the working group is to provide recommendations for a roadmap for future Arctic observational capacities. The roadmap is intended to help decision makers understand critical observational needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hajo Eicken, on behalf of Craig Lee, explained that a community white paper is being developed in support of sustained Arctic ocean system observing for decadal OceanObs 2019 meeting which will be held in mid-September. The Arctic paper being developed lays out the central challenges to Arctic Ocean observing and suggests different approaches. The paper intends to link what we need to know to specific observations. The development of the paper is ongoing and those interested in this topic should connect with Hajo Eicken or Craig Lee.&lt;/li&gt;

These topics are important not only for understanding the development of early social organization in North America but can also give us critical information about the societal impacts of sea level rise, which is a potential threat in coastal regions of the United States.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"9/21/2018","completed":"September 21, 2018","followupvalue":"20180921","id":1662,"users":[{"id":1080,"name":"Kate Ruck","link":"/members/people/4560"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","September 21, 2018"]}},{"milestone":271,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"September 27, 2018","shortdate":"9/27/2018","datevalue":"20180927","action":"<p><strong>US AON Recommendations to IARPC Principals</strong>:&nbsp; IARPC Principals formally recognized US AON as an IARPC activity at their November board meeting.&nbsp; It was agreed that the US AON Board is the Federal body of the broader IARPC Collaborations Observing Team.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Deliverable:</strong> <a href=\"/members/documents/10125\">Key Findings and Recommendations of the Consultative Phase of US AON</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"/members/documents/10125\">https://www.iarpccollaborations.org/members/documents/10125</a>)</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"9/27/2018","completed":"September 27, 2018","followupvalue":"20180927","id":1778,"users":[{"id":317,"name":"Sandy Starkweather","link":"/members/people/581"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","September 27, 2018"]}},{"milestone":271,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"September 27, 2018","shortdate":"9/27/2018","datevalue":"20180927","action":"<p><strong>Development of the US AON Board</strong>: US AON Board convened 7 times and concentrated their efforts on how the board could contribute to a strategic framework to guide US AON.&nbsp; The board has reviewed inputs, deliberated scope, and addressed fundamental needs.

In recent decades, the Arctic has transitioned to more mobile and thinner sea ice and more expansive stretches of open ocean. One outcome of these profound changes is the increasingly important role of Arctic Cyclones (ACs) in the loss of sea ice. An accurate prediction of such sea ice losses and the interplay between Arctic cyclones, sea ice and the open ocean is becoming increasing important for public safety, commerce, and national security. Unfortunately, the accurate prediction of ACs and sea ice loss is often a challenge, even on weather time-scales. This award supports continued planning for the Troposphere High latitude INhibitors to multi-scale sea ICE Predictability (THINICE) project to address this challenge. The sampling plan will include a 6-week international, multi-agency field campaign for July and August 2021 with a complementary numerical modeling and analysis component. This SPO is to organize the first systematic observational investigation to enhance our understanding of the critical mechanisms that determine the location, strength, evolution, and characteristics of Tropopause Polar Vortices (TPVs), ACs, and their potential for influencing sea ice break-up and decline.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"9/16/2019","completed":"September 16, 2019","followupvalue":"20190916","id":2085,"users":[{"id":1080,"name":"Kate Ruck","link":"/members/people/4560"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","September 16, 2019"]}},{"milestone":271,"editable":false,"type":"outstanding","typeclass":"outstanding","date":"September 25, 2019","shortdate":"9/25/2019","datevalue":"20190925","action":"<p>The multi-agency research coordination for high latitude activities is implemented mainly through IARPC activities.

The model incorporates the Los Alamos National Laboratory&amp;amp;rsquo;s Community Ice Code (CICE) and is used for seasonal predictions of Arctic sea ice cover submitted to the community Sea Ice Outlook. As compared to the first version of the S2S system, the new version shows significant improvement in the representation of Arctic sea ice extent, particularly for the late summer and fall.

(Feb 2020) GEOS‐S2S Version 2: The GMAO High‐Resolution Coupled Model and Assimilation System for Seasonal Prediction. JGR Atmospheres\n Abstract\n The Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) has recently released a new version of the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) Subseasonal to Seasonal prediction (S2S) system, GEOS‐S2S‐2, that represents a substantial improvement in performance and infrastructure over the previous system. The system is described here in detail, and results are presented from forecasts, climate equillibrium simulations, and data assimilation experiments. The climate or equillibrium state of the atmosphere and ocean showed a substantial reduction in bias relative to GEOS‐S2S‐1. The GEOS‐S2S‐2 coupled reanalysis also showed substantial improvements, attributed to the assimilation of along‐track absolute dynamic topography. The forecast skill on subseasonal scales showed a much improved prediction of the Madden‐Julian Oscillation in GEOS‐S2S‐2, and on a seasonal scale the tropical Pacific forecasts show substantial improvement in the east and comparable skill to GEOS‐S2S‐1 in the central Pacific.

The climate or equillibrium state of the atmosphere and ocean showed a substantial reduction in bias relative to GEOS‐S2S‐1. The GEOS‐S2S‐2 coupled reanalysis also showed substantial improvements, attributed to the assimilation of along‐track absolute dynamic topography. The forecast skill on subseasonal scales showed a much improved prediction of the Madden‐Julian Oscillation in GEOS‐S2S‐2, and on a seasonal scale the tropical Pacific forecasts show substantial improvement in the east and comparable skill to GEOS‐S2S‐1 in the central Pacific. GEOS‐S2S‐2 anomaly correlations of both land surface temperature and precipitation were comparable to GEOS‐S2S‐1 and showed substantially reduced root‐mean‐square error of surface temperature. The remaining issues described here are being addressed in the development of GEOS‐S2S Version 3, and with that system GMAO will continue its tradition of maintaining a state‐of‐the‐art seasonal prediction system for use in evaluating the impact on seasonal and decadal forecasts of assimilating newly available satellite observations, as well as evaluating additional sources of predictability in the Earth system through the expanded coupling of the Earth system model and assimilation components.&lt;/p&gt;" data-action-deadline="" data-action-completed="" data-action-contacts="[]">

&lt;p&gt;Tracy and Heilprin, marine-terminating glaciers that drain into the eastern end of Inglefield Gulf in northwest Greenland, exhibit remarkably different behaviors despite being adjacent systems. Losing mass since 1892, Tracy Glacier has dramatically accelerated, thinned, and retreated. Heilprin has retreated only slightly during the last century and has remained almost stationary in the most recent decade. Previous studies suggest that Tracy&amp;rsquo;s base is deeper than Heilprin&amp;rsquo;s at the calving front (over 600&amp;nbsp;m, as opposed to the 350 m depth at Heilprin), which exposes it to warmer subsurface waters, resulting in more rapid retreat. We investigate the local oceanographic conditions in Inglefield Gulf and their interactions with Tracy and Heilprin using data collected in 2016 and 2017 as part of&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;&amp;rsquo;s Oceans Melting Greenland mission. Based on improved estimates of the fjord geometry and 20 temperature and salinity profiles near the fronts of these two glaciers, we find clear evidence that fjord waters are modified by ocean-ice interactions with Tracy Glacier. We find that Tracy thinned by 9.9 m near its terminus between 2016 and 2017, while Heilprin thinned by only 1.8 m. Using a simple subglacial plume model, we find that Tracy&amp;rsquo;s deeper depth at the front results in a more vigorous entrainment of warm subsurface waters, leading to more rapid melting. Model results support the hypothesis that Tracy&amp;rsquo;s deeper front results in faster glacier retreat, despite the presence of a shallow sill (~300 m) that may prevent the warmest waters from reaching Tracy.&lt;/p&gt;" data-action-deadline="" data-action-completed="9/27/2018" data-action-contacts="[{&quot;id&quot;:279,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Christine Mataya&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:&quot;/members/people/286&quot;}]">

The investigators will then examine dynamical mechanisms that link Arctic circulation to remote drivers in the tropics and put circulation changes over the last 40 years into the context of longer centennial term changes.

Losing mass since 1892, Tracy Glacier has dramatically accelerated, thinned, and retreated. Heilprin has retreated only slightly during the last century and has remained almost stationary in the most recent decade. Previous studies suggest that Tracy&rsquo;s base is deeper than Heilprin&rsquo;s at the calving front (over 600&nbsp;m, as opposed to the 350 m depth at Heilprin), which exposes it to warmer subsurface waters, resulting in more rapid retreat.

Based on improved estimates of the fjord geometry and 20 temperature and salinity profiles near the fronts of these two glaciers, we find clear evidence that fjord waters are modified by ocean-ice interactions with Tracy Glacier. We find that Tracy thinned by 9.9 m near its terminus between 2016 and 2017, while Heilprin thinned by only 1.8 m. Using a simple subglacial plume model, we find that Tracy&rsquo;s deeper depth at the front results in a more vigorous entrainment of warm subsurface waters, leading to more rapid melting. Model results support the hypothesis that Tracy&rsquo;s deeper front results in faster glacier retreat, despite the presence of a shallow sill (~300 m) that may prevent the warmest waters from reaching Tracy.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"9/27/2018","completed":"September 27, 2018","followupvalue":"20180927","id":1815,"users":[{"id":279,"name":"Christine Mataya","link":"/members/people/286"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","September 27, 2018"]}},{"milestone":241,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"July 25, 2019","shortdate":"7/25/2019","datevalue":"20190725","action":"<p><span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\" data-hasqtip=\"3\">NASA</abbr>'s</span>&nbsp;<span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-4\" data-hasqtip=\"2\">ABoVE</abbr></span>&nbsp;Phase-2 project, Quantifying Socioeconomic Impacts of Changing Arctic Ecosystems Using<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-4\" data-hasqtip=\"1\">ABoVE</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>Datasets in an Integrated Human-Earth System Modeling and Data Assimilation Framework, led by<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-188\" data-hasqtip=\"15\">PI</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>Min Chen will contribute to this performance element.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>See<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\" data-hasqtip=\"16\">NASA</abbr>&rsquo;s official selection announcement for<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-4\" data-hasqtip=\"11\">ABoVE</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>Phase-2: https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/viewrepositorydocument/cmdocumentid=683777/solicitationId=%7BD192C005-8025-3258-3FEA-7F2F2EF82AE1%7D/viewSolicitationDocument=1/TE18%20selections%20updated.pdf</p>","shortdeadline":"7/5/2019","shortcompleted":"7/25/2019","completed":"July 25, 2019","followupvalue":"20190725","id":2015,"users":[],"followup":{"text":["Completed","July 25, 2019"]}},{"milestone":241,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"September 16, 2019","shortdate":"9/16/2019","datevalue":"20190916","action":"<p>The \"Winter Polar Vortex: Recent Disruptions and Weather Impacts\" workshop will be held&nbsp; September 11-13 at the Pacific Marine Ecosystems Laboratory (PMEL) in Seattle, Washington sponsored by CLIVAR&nbsp;with support from NOAA's&nbsp;Arctic Research Program.

These include in situ observations of sea ice cover and snow extent as well as remote sensing products and estimates of atmospheric circulation changes and outputs from climate models. Researchers will also use artificial intelligence (e.g., neural networks) to examine relationships between climate, atmospheric patterns and Greenland changes. Ultimately, this research is testing the hypothesis that atmospheric circulation changes associated with sea ice and snow cover extent variability control the mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet by modulating snowfall and surface melting. This research is also providing new insights on the linkages between the Arctic and mid-latitudes and how sea ice and snow cover changes might affect weather patterns outside the Arctic, including the United States.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"8/27/2019","completed":"August 27, 2019","followupvalue":"20190827","id":2047,"users":[{"id":1080,"name":"Kate Ruck","link":"/members/people/4560"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","August 27, 2019"]}},{"milestone":241,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"September 27, 2019","shortdate":"9/27/2019","datevalue":"20190927","action":"<p><a href=\"/members/events/12671\">Atmosphere and Modeling Meeting April 23rd Meeting</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"/members/documents/13361\">Agenda</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"/members/documents/13473\">Notes</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"/members/events/12671\">Recording</a>):</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span>Topic:&nbsp;</span><span>Polar Amplification Model<span>&nbsp;</span>Intercomparison<span>&nbsp;</span>Project (PAMIP)</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span>Presentations:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><a href=\"/members/documents/13393\"><span>The Polar Amplification&nbsp;MIP: Motivation and Overview</span></a><span>&mdash;</span><a href=\"/members/people/13390\"><span>Doug Smith</span></a><span>&nbsp;(Met Office)</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><a href=\"/members/documents/13388\"><span>Arctic-midlatitude<span>&nbsp;</span>linkages: initial results from atmosphere-only<span>&nbsp;</span>PAMIPexperiments</span></a><span>&mdash;</span><a href=\"/members/people/13380\"><span>Yannick<span>&nbsp;</span>Peings</span></a><span>&nbsp;(U California Irvine)</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><a href=\"/members/documents/13394\"><span>PAMIP&nbsp;&ndash; discussion on coupled model simulations</span></a><span>&mdash;Stephanie<span>&nbsp;</span>Hay (U Toronto)</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Highlights:&nbsp;Doug focused on the consequences of Arctic amplification and the differences in atmosphere and coupled models as well as different forcing and implications of the background state (coupled model biases) The presentations by<span>&nbsp;</span>Yannick<span>&nbsp;</span>and Stephanie addressed specifics of mid-latitude linkages and coupled model simulations.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"9/27/2019","completed":"September 27, 2019","followupvalue":"20190927","id":2189,"users":[],"followup":{"text":["Completed","September 27, 2019"]}},{"milestone":241,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"October 4, 2019","shortdate":"10/4/2019","datevalue":"20191004","action":"<p>The Regional and Global Model Analysis (RGMA) component of DOE&rsquo;s Earth and Environmental System Modeling (EESM) program approved Phase II of the High-Latitude Application and Testing of Earth System Models (HiLAT; <a href=\"https://www.hilat.org/\">https://www.hilat.org</a>) Science Focus Area.

The model incorporates the Los Alamos National Laboratory&amp;rsquo;s Community Ice Code (CICE) and is used for seasonal predictions of Arctic sea ice cover submitted to the community Sea Ice Outlook. As compared to the first version of the S2S system, the new version shows significant improvement in the representation of Arctic sea ice extent, particularly for the late summer and fall. The model also incorporates a more realistic depiction of ice sheet surface processes.<br /> Molod et al. (Feb 2020) GEOS‐S2S Version 2: The GMAO High‐Resolution Coupled Model and Assimilation System for Seasonal Prediction. JGR Atmospheres<br /> Abstract<br /> The Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) has recently released a new version of the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) Subseasonal to Seasonal prediction (S2S) system, GEOS‐S2S‐2, that represents a substantial improvement in performance and infrastructure over the previous system. The system is described here in detail, and results are presented from forecasts, climate equillibrium simulations, and data assimilation experiments. The climate or equillibrium state of the atmosphere and ocean showed a substantial reduction in bias relative to GEOS‐S2S‐1. The GEOS‐S2S‐2 coupled reanalysis also showed substantial improvements, attributed to the assimilation of along‐track absolute dynamic topography. The forecast skill on subseasonal scales showed a much improved prediction of the Madden‐Julian Oscillation in GEOS‐S2S‐2, and on a seasonal scale the tropical Pacific forecasts show substantial improvement in the east and comparable skill to GEOS‐S2S‐1 in the central Pacific. GEOS‐S2S‐2 anomaly correlations of both land surface temperature and precipitation were comparable to GEOS‐S2S‐1 and showed substantially reduced root‐mean‐square error of surface temperature. The remaining issues described here are being addressed in the development of GEOS‐S2S Version 3, and with that system GMAO will continue its tradition of maintaining a state‐of‐the‐art seasonal prediction system for use in evaluating the impact on seasonal and decadal forecasts of assimilating newly available satellite observations, as well as evaluating additional sources of predictability in the Earth system through the expanded coupling of the Earth system model and assimilation components.</span></p>\r\n<p>(Partially completed)</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"","completed":"","followupvalue":"","id":2765,"users":[{"id":279,"name":"Christine Mataya","link":"/members/people/286"}],"followup":null},{"milestone":241,"editable":false,"type":"outstanding","typeclass":"outstanding","date":"February 8, 2021","shortdate":"2/8/2021","datevalue":"20210208","action":"<p><span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;NASA contributed to this performance element in the following way:\\n The multi-agency research coordination for high latitude activities is implemented mainly through IARPC activities.

                <p></p><p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) has recently awarded OPP – 1758565. The Pacific inflow to the Arctic Ocean (which is via the Bering Strait) is critical to the oceanic systems of the Alaskan seas and western Arctic Ocean. The core of this work will be the installation and annual servicing of three oceanographic moorings in the Bering Strait, at sites which have been shown to provide an effective quantification of the oceanic fluxes through the strait. These moorings measure (hourly, year-round) water velocity, water temperature and salinity, and the thickness and motion of the seasonal sea ice in the region. This new research will continue these measurements to 2022, also seeking understanding of the drivers of recent change. The work will provide oceanic information in useful forms to the many stakeholders, including local and global science, local native communities, the public, and industry (e.g., oil/gas exploration, shipping, tourism). Internationally, the project is a substantial US contribution to global cooperation in the Arctic.</p><p></p>

Analysis of satellite altimetry, coastal sea level, theory, and a model will be used to: determine the origin and dynamics of the low-frequency pressure head that drives flow through the Bering Strait into the Arctic; understand the origin and basic dynamics of the interannual sea level and flow on the wide Bering Sea shelf; and determine the low-frequency variability of volume, heat, and fresh water flux of the Alaskan Coastal Current. A wealth of along-track satellite altimeter data available from TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason1,2,3 (TPJ123) will be used to address the question of what drives the Bering Sea pressure head. Preliminary analysis suggests that a major contributor to the low-frequency Bering Strait pressure head originates on the Gulf of Alaska continental shelf.

&lt;p&gt;A recent study (Zhang et al., 2019) found that snow cover decreases (over land and sea ice) accounts for about 70% of the satellite-observed reduction in Arctic surface albedo since the 1980s. The snow cover decreases are caused by a warmer surface and an increasing fraction of precipitation appearing as rain, rather than snow. The retreat in sea ice extent is also a contributing factor to albedo reduction where its primary role in regulating heat and moisture exchanges is also reduced. Researchers found that soot deposits do not appear to be an important driver of the observed Arctic surface albedo reduction as the magnitude of heating is relatively small and the deposits have been declining since the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;

The objective of proposed research under Phase 2 of SIPN (SIPN2) is to improve forecast skill through adopting a multi-disciplinary approach that includes modeling, new products, data analysis, scientific networks, and stakeholder engagement. This grant will: Investigate the sensitivity of subseasonal-to-seasonal sea-ice predictability in the Alaska Arctic to variations in oceanic heat and large- scale atmospheric forcing using a dynamical model Community Earth System Model (NCAR CESM) and statistical forecasting tools, focusing on spatial fields in addition to total extent summaries; Assess the accuracy of Sea Ice Outlook (SIO) submissions based on methodology and initialization; Develop new observation-based products for improving sea-ice predictions, including sea-ice thickness, surface roughness, melt ponds, and snow depth; Evaluate the socio-economic value of sea-ice forecasts to stakeholders who manage ship traffic and coastal village resupply in the Alaska Sector, and engage the public in Arctic climate and sea-ice prediction through blog exchanges, accessible SIO reports, bi-monthly webinars, and by making public data sources useful to non-scientists and scientists alike; and Continue and evolve network activities to generate SIO forecasts and reporting for September minima as in SIPN and expand SIPN2 forecasts to include full spatial resolution and emerging ice-anomaly-months (October - November).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                <p></p><p>The National Science Foundation has recently awarded OPP – 1749081. The objective of proposed research under Phase 2 of SIPN (SIPN2) is to improve forecast skill through adopting a multi-disciplinary approach that includes modeling, new products, data analysis, scientific networks, and stakeholder engagement. This grant will: Investigate the sensitivity of subseasonal-to-seasonal sea-ice predictability in the Alaska Arctic to variations in oceanic heat and large- scale atmospheric forcing using a dynamical model Community Earth System Model (NCAR CESM) and statistical forecasting tools, focusing on spatial fields in addition to total extent summaries; Assess the accuracy of Sea Ice Outlook (SIO) submissions based on methodology and initialization; Develop new observation-based products for improving sea-ice predictions, including sea-ice thickness, surface roughness, melt ponds, and snow depth; Evaluate the socio-economic value of sea-ice forecasts to stakeholders who manage ship traffic and coastal village resupply in the Alaska Sector, and engage the public in Arctic climate and sea-ice prediction through blog exchanges, accessible SIO reports, bi-monthly webinars, and by making public data sources useful to non-scientists and scientists alike; and Continue and evolve network activities to generate SIO forecasts and reporting for September minima as in SIPN and expand SIPN2 forecasts to include full spatial resolution and emerging ice-anomaly-months (October - November).</p>

The Bering Strait connects the Pacific and Arctic Oceans, and serves as a conduit of nutrients, heat, and fresh water. Understanding the factors influencing that connection will help predict current and future regional ocean conditions. Analysis of satellite altimetry, coastal sea level, theory, and a model will be used to: determine the origin and dynamics of the low-frequency pressure head that drives flow through the Bering Strait into the Arctic; understand the origin and basic dynamics of the interannual sea level and flow on the wide Bering Sea shelf; and determine the low-frequency variability of volume, heat, and fresh water flux of the Alaskan Coastal Current. A wealth of along-track satellite altimeter data available from TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason1,2,3 (TPJ123) will be used to address the question of what drives the Bering Sea pressure head. Preliminary analysis suggests that a major contributor to the low-frequency Bering Strait pressure head originates on the Gulf of Alaska continental shelf. This contribution is communicated along the Gulf of Alaska coastal wave guide, through Unimak Pass in the Aleutian Arc, onto the shallow Bering Sea shelf wave guide, and then through the Bering Strait.

This is a modeling proposal to study the effect of declining Arctic sea ice on the strength and other characteristics of the AMOC - a major element of ocean dynamics and climate. Sea ice decline exposes the Arctic ocean to anomalous solar radiation and freshwater fluxes, generating positive buoyancy anomalies in the upper ocean. The hypothesis being tested is that, when spreading to the North Atlantic these buoyancy anomalies effectively weaken ocean deep convection, leading to a slow-down of the AMOC on multi-decadal timescales. This hypothesis will be tested with a variety of methods ranging from adjoint ocean modeling to experiments with climate models.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"9/21/2018","completed":"September 21, 2018","followupvalue":"20180921","id":1676,"users":[{"id":1080,"name":"Kate Ruck","link":"/members/people/4560"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","September 21, 2018"]}},{"milestone":243,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"September 24, 2018","shortdate":"9/24/2018","datevalue":"20180924","action":"<p>The National Science Foundation has recently awarded OPP &ndash; 1749081.

Ethane and acetylene measurements in firn air and shallow ice cores demonstrate that the entrapped air in polar ice contains a paleoatmospheric record of these trace gases. In this study, the investigators will analyze ethane and acetylene in ice core samples from the GISP2 ice core (Summit, Greenland), spanning the last glacial maximum, glacial/interglacial transition, and Holocene periods. Trace gas emissions will be inferred from the atmospheric histories using a 3-D global photochemical/transport model and biogeochemical box models.

(Feb 2020) GEOS‐S2S Version 2: The GMAO High‐Resolution Coupled Model and Assimilation System for Seasonal Prediction. JGR Atmospheres\n Abstract\n The Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) has recently released a new version of the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) Subseasonal to Seasonal prediction (S2S) system, GEOS‐S2S‐2, that represents a substantial improvement in performance and infrastructure over the previous system. The system is described here in detail, and results are presented from forecasts, climate equillibrium simulations, and data assimilation experiments. The climate or equillibrium state of the atmosphere and ocean showed a substantial reduction in bias relative to GEOS‐S2S‐1. The GEOS‐S2S‐2 coupled reanalysis also showed substantial improvements, attributed to the assimilation of along‐track absolute dynamic topography. The forecast skill on subseasonal scales showed a much improved prediction of the Madden‐Julian Oscillation in GEOS‐S2S‐2, and on a seasonal scale the tropical Pacific forecasts show substantial improvement in the east and comparable skill to GEOS‐S2S‐1 in the central Pacific. GEOS‐S2S‐2 anomaly correlations of both land surface temperature and precipitation were comparable to GEOS‐S2S‐1 and showed substantially reduced root‐mean‐square error of surface temperature. The remaining issues described here are being addressed in the development of GEOS‐S2S Version 3, and with that system GMAO will continue its tradition of maintaining a state‐of‐the‐art seasonal prediction system for use in evaluating the impact on seasonal and decadal forecasts of assimilating newly available satellite observations, as well as evaluating additional sources of predictability in the Earth system through the expanded coupling of the Earth system model and assimilation components.&amp;quot;}&quot; data-sheets-userformat=&quot;{&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;:4993,&amp;quot;3&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;:0},&amp;quot;10&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;11&amp;quot;:4,&amp;quot;12&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;15&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;NASA contributed to this performance element through the following: The NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) published a new version of its Subseasonal to Seasonal (S2S) prediction system (Molod et al. 2020, https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JD031767).

JGR Atmospheres &lt;br /&gt;Abstract&lt;br /&gt;The Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) has recently released a new version of the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) Subseasonal to Seasonal prediction (S2S) system, GEOS‐S2S‐2, that represents a substantial improvement in performance and infrastructure over the previous system. The system is described here in detail, and results are presented from forecasts, climate equillibrium simulations, and data assimilation experiments. The climate or equillibrium state of the atmosphere and ocean showed a substantial reduction in bias relative to GEOS‐S2S‐1. The GEOS‐S2S‐2 coupled reanalysis also showed substantial improvements, attributed to the assimilation of along‐track absolute dynamic topography. The forecast skill on subseasonal scales showed a much improved prediction of the Madden‐Julian Oscillation in GEOS‐S2S‐2, and on a seasonal scale the tropical Pacific forecasts show substantial improvement in the east and comparable skill to GEOS‐S2S‐1 in the central Pacific. GEOS‐S2S‐2 anomaly correlations of both land surface temperature and precipitation were comparable to GEOS‐S2S‐1 and showed substantially reduced root‐mean‐square error of surface temperature. The remaining issues described here are being addressed in the development of GEOS‐S2S Version 3, and with that system GMAO will continue its tradition of maintaining a state‐of‐the‐art seasonal prediction system for use in evaluating the impact on seasonal and decadal forecasts of assimilating newly available satellite observations, as well as evaluating additional sources of predictability in the Earth system through the expanded coupling of the Earth system model and assimilation components.&lt;/p&gt;" data-action-deadline="" data-action-completed="" data-action-contacts="[]">

Results will help set priorities for model improvement and model selection to enable more robust conclusions about the trajectory of Arctic terrestrial surface wetness.</p><p></p>

We compare these to forecasts produced using data from a sophisticated melt pond model, and find similar to higher skill values, where the forecast skill is calculated relative to linear trend persistence. The MO forecasts shows the highest skill in March&amp;ndash;May, while the SIC forecasts produce the highest skill in June&amp;ndash;August, especially when the forecasts are evaluated over recent years (since 2008). The high MO forecast skill in early spring appears to be driven primarily by the presence and timing of open water anomalies, while the high SIC forecast skill appears to be driven by both open water and surface melt processes. Spatial maps of detrended anomalies highlight the drivers of the different forecasts, and enable us to understand regions of predictive importance. Correctly capturing sea ice state anomalies, along with changes in open water coverage appear to be key processes in skillfully forecasting summer Arctic sea ice.&lt;/p&gt;" data-action-deadline="" data-action-completed="9/27/2018" data-action-contacts="[{&quot;id&quot;:279,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Christine Mataya&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:&quot;/members/people/286&quot;}]">

The MO forecasts shows the highest skill in March&ndash;May, while the SIC forecasts produce the highest skill in June&ndash;August, especially when the forecasts are evaluated over recent years (since 2008). The high MO forecast skill in early spring appears to be driven primarily by the presence and timing of open water anomalies, while the high SIC forecast skill appears to be driven by both open water and surface melt processes. Spatial maps of detrended anomalies highlight the drivers of the different forecasts, and enable us to understand regions of predictive importance.

In regions with sea ice the SST is the temperature of open water or of the water under the ice. A number of different proxy SST estimates based on SIC have been developed. In recent years more Arctic quality-control buoy SSTs have become available, allowing better validation of different estimates and the development of improved proxy estimates. Here proxy SSTs from different approaches are evaluated and an improved proxy SST method is shown. The improved proxy SSTs were tested in an SST analysis, and showed reduced bias and random errors compared to the Arctic buoy SSTs. Almost all reduction in errors is in the warm melt season. In the cold season the SIC is typically high and all estimates tend to have low errors. The improved method will be incorporated into an operational SST analysis.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"","completed":"","followupvalue":"","id":2543,"users":[],"followup":null},{"milestone":182,"editable":false,"type":"outstanding","typeclass":"outstanding","date":"September 11, 2020","shortdate":"9/11/2020","datevalue":"20200911","action":"<p>NASA contributed to this performance element through the following:</p>\r\n<p>&bull; The NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) published a new version of its Subseasonal to Seasonal (S2S) prediction system (Molod et al. 2020, https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JD031767).

The forecast skill on subseasonal scales showed a much improved prediction of the Madden‐Julian Oscillation in GEOS‐S2S‐2, and on a seasonal scale the tropical Pacific forecasts show substantial improvement in the east and comparable skill to GEOS‐S2S‐1 in the central Pacific. GEOS‐S2S‐2 anomaly correlations of both land surface temperature and precipitation were comparable to GEOS‐S2S‐1 and showed substantially reduced root‐mean‐square error of surface temperature. The remaining issues described here are being addressed in the development of GEOS‐S2S Version 3, and with that system GMAO will continue its tradition of maintaining a state‐of‐the‐art seasonal prediction system for use in evaluating the impact on seasonal and decadal forecasts of assimilating newly available satellite observations, as well as evaluating additional sources of predictability in the Earth system through the expanded coupling of the Earth system model and assimilation components.</span></p>\r\n<p>(Partially completed)</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"","completed":"","followupvalue":"","id":2766,"users":[{"id":279,"name":"Christine Mataya","link":"/members/people/286"}],"followup":null},{"milestone":182,"editable":false,"type":"outstanding","typeclass":"outstanding","date":"February 8, 2021","shortdate":"2/8/2021","datevalue":"20210208","action":"<p><span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;NASA funded the following:\\n &amp;bull; Preliminary analysis of air-sea temperature differences measured from NASA funded Saildrones using back-trajectories of airflow.\\n &amp;bull; Research to improve satellite SSTs in the Arctic.

&lt;p&gt;Highlights: The Forum for Arctic Ocean Modeling and Observational Synthesis (FAMOS) is an international effort to focus on enhancing collaboration and coordination among arctic marine and sea ice modelers, theoreticians and observationalists based on a set of activities starting from generating hypotheses, to planning research included both observations and modeling, and to finalizing analyses synthesizing major results from the field studies and coordinated numerical experiments. In this meeting we will review FAMOS and get an overview of the Climate Response Functions &amp;ndash; such as the Greenland Sea Win Anomalies effects on the Arctic Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;" data-action-deadline="" data-action-completed="10/14/2019" data-action-contacts="[]">

<p>Highlights: The Forum for Arctic Ocean Modeling and Observational Synthesis (FAMOS) is an international effort to focus on enhancing collaboration and coordination among arctic marine and sea ice modelers, theoreticians and observationalists based on a set of activities starting from generating hypotheses, to planning research included both observations and modeling, and to finalizing analyses synthesizing major results from the field studies and coordinated numerical experiments. In this meeting we will review FAMOS and get an overview of the Climate Response Functions – such as the Greenland Sea Win Anomalies effects on the Arctic Ocean.</p><p></p>

Rapid warming in boreal forests has driven diverse ecosystem changes in recent decades, including permafrost thaw, longer non-frozen seasons, and warmer summers. The impact of these changes on the carbon balance of boreal forests remains highly uncertain. A growing body of evidence indicates that boreal forests are shifting toward being a net carbon dioxide source due to increases in soil respiration. To offset this loss of carbon, ecosystems rely on sustained vegetation uptake and accumulation of carbon through plant photosynthesis. However, it is unclear how environmental conditions, particularly moisture and temperature, affect the timing, duration and magnitude of photosynthetic carbon uptake (i.e., photosynthetic phenology) across boreal plant functional types. To address these important knowledge gaps, this study focuses on a leaf-to-watershed analysis at the Caribou-Poker Creek (BONA) Watershed in Alaska. Specifically, the study seeks to answer the question, &ldquo;What are the environmental and biological controls of photosynthetic phenology in permafrost-affected boreal forests?&rdquo; Newly gained insight will be used to optimize a data and process-model integration framework using the remote-sensing driven CARbon Data Model (CARDAMOM) and to extend from the BONA watershed to the boreal forests of Alaska and northwestern Canada.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"9/3/2020","completed":"September 3, 2020","followupvalue":"20200903","id":2486,"users":[{"id":1080,"name":"Kate Ruck","link":"/members/people/4560"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","September 3, 2020"]}}];

Over the data-sparse sea ice zone, the retrospective assimilation of observations in numerical reanalyses has been thought to offer a possible, but challenging, avenue for adequately reproducing the historical time series. Focusing on the central Arctic Ocean, output is analyzed from 12 reanalyses with a specific consideration of two widely used products: the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim, hereafter ERA-I). Among the reanalyses considered, a trend of 0.9 K decade&amp;amp;minus;1 is indicated but with an uncertainty of 6%, and a large spread in mean values. There is a partitioning among those reanalyses that use fractional sea ice cover and those that employ a threshold, which are colder in winter by an average of 2 K but agree more closely with in situ observations. For reanalyses using fractional sea ice cover, discrepancies in the ice fraction in autumn and winter explain most of the differences in air temperature values. A set of experiments using the MERRA-2 background model using MERRA-2 and ERA-I sea ice and sea surface temperature indicates significant effects of boundary condition differences on air temperatures, and a preferential warm bias inherent in the MERRA-2 model sea ice representation. Differences between experiments and reanalyses suggest the available observations apply a significant constraint on reanalysis mean temperatures.\n &amp;amp;bull; A recent paper examined trends in top-of-atmosphere radiative fluxes from atmospheric reanalyses in comparison to satellite-derived measurements using the CERES instrument (Wu et al., 2020, https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12091460). The study finds the Arctic flux variations are highly correlated with cloud fraction, while reanalyses exhibit substantial shortcomings in representing the polar TOA flux variability.\n Abstract\n Recent changes in Earth&amp;amp;rsquo;s climate system have significantly affected the radiation budget and its year-to-year variations at top of the atmosphere (TOA). Observing high-latitude TOA fluxes is still challenging from space, because spatial inhomogeneity of surface/atmospheric radiative processes and spectral variability can reflect sunlight very differently. In this study we analyze the 20-year TOA flux and albedo data from CERES and MISR over the Arctic, the Antarctic, and Tibetan Plateau (TP), and found overall great consistency in the TOA albedo trend and interannual variations. The observations reveal a lagged correlation between the Arctic and subarctic albedo fluctuations. The observed year-to-year variations are further used to evaluate the reanalysis data, which exhibit substantial shortcomings in representing the polar TOA flux variability. The observed Arctic flux variations are highly correlated with cloud fraction (CF), except in the regions where CF &amp;amp;gt; 90% or where the surface is covered by ice. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis shows that the first five EOFs can account for ~50% of the Arctic TOA variance, whereas the correlation with climate indices suggests that Sea Ice Extent (SIE), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and 55&amp;amp;deg;N&amp;amp;ndash;65&amp;amp;deg;N cloudiness are the most influential processes in driving the TOA flux variabilities.&amp;quot;}&quot; data-sheets-userformat=&quot;{&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;:4993,&amp;quot;3&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;:0},&amp;quot;10&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;11&amp;quot;:4,&amp;quot;12&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;15&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;NASA contributed to this performance element through the following:&lt;br /&gt;A paper from NASA Goddard provides a comprehensive overview of differences in surface air temperatures over the Arctic Ocean depicted in 12 atmospheric reanalyses.

&lt;p&gt;Abstract. Ice flow models of the Antarctic ice sheet are commonly used to simulate its future evolution in response to different climate scenarios and inform on the mass loss that would contribute to future sea level rise. However, there is currently no consensus on estimated the future mass balance of the ice sheet, primarily because of differences in the representation of physical processes and the forcings employed. This study presents results from 18 simulations from 15 international groups focusing on the evolution of the Antarctic ice sheet during the period 2015&amp;ndash;2100, forced with different scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) representative of the spread in climate model results. The contribution of the Antarctic ice sheet in response to increased warming during this period varies between &amp;minus;7.8 and 30.0&amp;thinsp;cm of Sea Level Equivalent (SLE). The evolution of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet varies widely among models, with an overall mass loss up to 21.0&amp;thinsp;cm SLE in response to changes in oceanic conditions. East Antarctica mass change varies between &amp;minus;6.5 and 16.5&amp;thinsp;cm SLE, with a significant increase in surface mass balance outweighing the increased ice discharge under most RCP 8.5 scenario forcings. The inclusion of ice shelf collapse, here assumed to be caused by large amounts of liquid water ponding at the surface of ice shelves, yields an additional mass loss of 8&amp;thinsp;mm compared to simulations without ice shelf collapse. The largest sources of uncertainty come from the ocean-induced melt rates, the calibration of these melt rates based on oceanic conditions taken outside of ice shelf cavities and the ice sheet dynamic response to these oceanic changes. Results under RCP 2.6 scenario based on two CMIP5 AOGCMs show an overall mass loss of 10&amp;thinsp;mm SLE compared to simulations done under present-day conditions, with limited mass gain in East Antarctica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goelzer et al. The future sea-level contribution of the Greenland ice sheet: a multi-model ensemble study of ISMIP6, The Cryosphere Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2019-319, in review, 2020.&lt;br /&gt;Abstract. The Greenland ice sheet is one of the largest contributors to global-mean sea-level rise today and is expected to continue to lose mass as the Arctic continues to warm. The two predominant mass loss mechanisms are increased surface meltwater runoff and mass loss associated with the retreat of marine-terminating outlet glaciers. In this paper we use a large ensemble of Greenland ice sheet models forced by output from a representative subset of CMIP5 global climate models to project ice sheet changes and sea-level rise contributions over the 21st century. The simulations are part of the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6 (ISMIP6). We estimate the sea-level contribution together with uncertainties due to future climate forcing, ice sheet model formulations and ocean forcing for the two greenhouse gas concentration scenarios RCP8.5 and RCP2.6. The results indicate that the Greenland ice sheet will continue to lose mass in both scenarios until 2100 with contributions of 89&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;51&amp;thinsp;mm and 31&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;16&amp;thinsp;mm to sea-level rise for RCP8.5 and RCP2.6, respectively. The largest mass loss is expected from the southwest of Greenland, which is governed by surface mass balance changes, continuing what is already observed today. Because the contributions are calculated against a unforced control experiment, these numbers do not include any committed mass loss, i.e. mass loss that would occur over the coming century if the climate forcing remained constant. Under RCP8.5 forcing, ice sheet model uncertainty explains an ensemble spread of 40&amp;thinsp;mm, while climate model uncertainty and ocean forcing uncertainty account for a spread of 36&amp;thinsp;mm and 19&amp;thinsp;mm, respectively. Apart from those formally derived uncertainty ranges, the largest gap in our knowledge is about the physical understanding and implementation of the calving process, i.e. the interaction of the ice sheet with the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slater et al. Estimating Greenland tidewater glacier retreat driven by submarine melting, The Cryosphere, 13, 2489&amp;ndash;2509, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2489-2019, 2019.&lt;br /&gt;Abstract&lt;br /&gt;The effect of the North Atlantic Ocean on the Greenland Ice Sheet through submarine melting of Greenland&#39;s tidewater glacier calving fronts is thought to be a key driver of widespread glacier retreat, dynamic mass loss and sea level contribution from the ice sheet. Despite its critical importance, problems of process complexity and scale hinder efforts to represent the influence of submarine melting in ice-sheet-scale models. Here we propose parameterizing tidewater glacier terminus position as a simple linear function of submarine melting, with submarine melting in turn estimated as a function of subglacial discharge and ocean temperature. The relationship is tested, calibrated and validated using datasets of terminus position, subglacial discharge and ocean temperature covering the full ice sheet and surrounding ocean from the period 1960&amp;ndash;2018. We demonstrate a statistically significant link between multi-decadal tidewater glacier terminus position change and submarine melting and show that the proposed parameterization has predictive power when considering a population of glaciers. An illustrative 21st century projection is considered, suggesting that tidewater glaciers in Greenland will undergo little further retreat in a low-emission RCP2.6 scenario. In contrast, a high-emission RCP8.5 scenario results in a median retreat of 4.2&amp;thinsp;km, with a quarter of tidewater glaciers experiencing retreat exceeding 10&amp;thinsp;km. Our study provides a long-term and ice-sheet-wide assessment of the sensitivity of tidewater glaciers to submarine melting and proposes a practical and empirically validated means of incorporating ocean forcing into models of the Greenland ice sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barthel et al. CMIP5 model selection for ISMIP6 ice sheet model forcing: Greenland and Antarctica, The Cryosphere, 14, 855&amp;ndash;879, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-855-2020, 2020.&lt;br /&gt;Abstract&lt;br /&gt;The ice sheet model intercomparison project for CMIP6 (ISMIP6) effort brings together the ice sheet and climate modeling communities to gain understanding of the ice sheet contribution to sea level rise. ISMIP6 conducts stand-alone ice sheet experiments that use space- and time-varying forcing derived from atmosphere&amp;ndash;ocean coupled global climate models (AOGCMs) to reflect plausible trajectories for climate projections. The goal of this study is to recommend a subset of CMIP5 AOGCMs (three core and three targeted) to produce forcing for ISMIP6 stand-alone ice sheet simulations, based on (i) their representation of current climate near Antarctica and Greenland relative to observations and (ii) their ability to sample a diversity of projected atmosphere and ocean changes over the 21st century. The selection is performed separately for Greenland and Antarctica. Model evaluation over the historical period focuses on variables used to generate ice sheet forcing. For stage (i), we combine metrics of atmosphere and surface ocean state (annual- and seasonal-mean variables over large spatial domains) with metrics of time-mean subsurface ocean temperature biases averaged over sectors of the continental shelf. For stage (ii), we maximize the diversity of climate projections among the best-performing models. Model selection is also constrained by technical limitations, such as availability of required data from RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 projections. The selected top three CMIP5 climate models are CCSM4, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, and NorESM1-M for Antarctica and HadGEM2-ES, MIROC5, and NorESM1-M for Greenland. This model selection was designed specifically for ISMIP6 but can be adapted for other applications.&lt;/p&gt;

Twenty-first century ocean forcing of the Greenland ice sheet for modelling of sea level contribution , The Cryosphere, 14, 985&amp;ndash;1008, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-985-2020, 2020.&lt;br /&gt;Abstract&lt;br /&gt;Changes in ocean temperature and salinity are expected to be an important determinant of the Greenland ice sheet&#39;s future sea level contribution. Yet, simulating the impact of these changes in continental-scale ice sheet models remains challenging due to the small scale of key physics, such as fjord circulation and plume dynamics, and poor understanding of critical processes, such as calving and submarine melting. Here we present the ocean forcing strategy for Greenland ice sheet models taking part in the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6 (ISMIP6), the primary community effort to provide 21st century sea level projections for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report. Beginning from global atmosphere&amp;ndash;ocean general circulation models, we describe two complementary approaches to provide ocean boundary conditions for Greenland ice sheet models, termed the &amp;ldquo;retreat&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;submarine melt&amp;rdquo; implementations. The retreat implementation parameterises glacier retreat as a function of projected subglacial discharge and ocean thermal forcing, is designed to be implementable by all ice sheet models and results in retreat of around 1 and 15&amp;thinsp;km by 2100 in RCP2.6 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively. The submarine melt implementation provides estimated submarine melting only, leaving the ice sheet model to solve for the resulting calving and glacier retreat and suggests submarine melt rates will change little under RCP2.6 but will approximately triple by 2100 under RCP8.5. Both implementations have necessarily made use of simplifying assumptions and poorly constrained parameterisations and, as such, further research on submarine melting, calving and fjord&amp;ndash;shelf exchange should remain a priority. Nevertheless, the presented framework will allow an ensemble of Greenland ice sheet models to be systematically and consistently forced by the ocean for the first time and should result in a significant improvement in projections of the Greenland ice sheet&#39;s contribution to future sea level change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jourdain et al. A protocol for calculating basal melt rates in the ISMIP6 Antarctic ice sheet projections, The Cryosphere Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2019-277, in review, 2019.&lt;br /&gt;Abstract&lt;br /&gt;Climate model projections have previously been used to compute ice-shelf basal melt rates in ice-sheet models, but the strategies employed &amp;ndash; e.g. ocean input, parameterization, calibration technique, and corrections &amp;ndash; have varied widely and are often ad-hoc. Here, a methodology is proposed for the calculation of circum-Antarctic basal melt rates for floating ice, based on climate models, that is suitable for ISMIP6, the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6 (6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project). The past and future evolution of ocean temperature and salinity is derived from a climate model by estimating anomalies with respect to the modern day, which are added to an present-day climatology constructed from existing observational datasets. Temperature and salinity are extrapolated to any position potentially occupied by a simulated ice shelf. A simple formulation is proposed for a basal-melt parameterization in ISMIP6, constrained by the observed temperature climatology, with a quadratic dependency on either the non-local or local thermal forcing. Two calibration methods are proposed: 1) based on the mean Antarctic melt rate (MeanAnt) and 2) based on melt rates near Pine Island&#39;s deep grounding line (PIGL). Future Antarctic mean melt rates are an order of magnitude greater in PIGL than in MeanAnt. The PIGL calibration, and the local parameterization, result in more realistic melt rates near grounding lines. PIGL is also more consistent with observations of interannual melt rate variability underneath Pine Island and Dotson ice shelves. This work stresses the need for more physics and less calibration in the parameterizations, and for more observations of hydrographic properties and melt rates at interannual and decadal time scales.&lt;/p&gt;

This paper describes the experimental setup for process-based sea level change projections to be performed with stand-alone Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet models in the context of ISMIP6. The ISMIP6 protocol relies on a suite of polar atmospheric and oceanic CMIP-based forcing for ice sheet models, in order to explore the uncertainty in projected sea level change due to future emissions scenarios, CMIP models, ice sheet models, and parameterizations for ice&amp;ndash;ocean interactions. We describe here the approach taken for defining the suite of ISMIP6 stand-alone ice sheet simulations, document the experimental framework and implementation, and present an overview of the ISMIP6 forcing to be used by participating ice sheet modeling groups.&lt;/p&gt;

In this work we address the problems arising from a mismatch of the modelled ice sheet geometry with the geometry used by the climate model. We present a method for applying SMB forcing from climate models to a wide range of Greenland ice sheet models with varying and temporally evolving geometries. In order to achieve that, we translate a given SMB anomaly field as a function of absolute location to a function of surface elevation for 25 regional drainage basins, which can then be applied to different modelled ice sheet geometries. The key feature of the approach is the non-locality of this remapping process. The method reproduces the original forcing data closely when remapped to the original geometry. When remapped to different modelled geometries it produces a physically meaningful forcing with smooth and continuous SMB anomalies across basin divides. The method considerably reduces non-physical biases that would arise by applying the SMB anomaly derived for the climate model geometry directly to a large range of modelled ice sheet model geometries.&lt;/p&gt;" data-action-deadline="" data-action-completed="" data-action-contacts="[]">

This study presents results from 18 simulations from 15 international groups focusing on the evolution of the Antarctic ice sheet during the period 2015–2100, forced with different scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) representative of the spread in climate model results. The contribution of the Antarctic ice sheet in response to increased warming during this period varies between −7.8 and 30.0 cm of Sea Level Equivalent (SLE). The evolution of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet varies widely among models, with an overall mass loss up to 21.0 cm SLE in response to changes in oceanic conditions. East Antarctica mass change varies between −6.5 and 16.5 cm SLE, with a significant increase in surface mass balance outweighing the increased ice discharge under most RCP 8.5 scenario forcings. The inclusion of ice shelf collapse, here assumed to be caused by large amounts of liquid water ponding at the surface of ice shelves, yields an additional mass loss of 8 mm compared to simulations without ice shelf collapse. The largest sources of uncertainty come from the ocean-induced melt rates, the calibration of these melt rates based on oceanic conditions taken outside of ice shelf cavities and the ice sheet dynamic response to these oceanic changes. Results under RCP 2.6 scenario based on two CMIP5 AOGCMs show an overall mass loss of 10 mm SLE compared to simulations done under present-day conditions, with limited mass gain in East Antarctica.</p>

The future sea-level contribution of the Greenland ice sheet: a multi-model ensemble study of ISMIP6, The Cryosphere Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2019-319, in review, 2020.<br>Abstract. The Greenland ice sheet is one of the largest contributors to global-mean sea-level rise today and is expected to continue to lose mass as the Arctic continues to warm. The two predominant mass loss mechanisms are increased surface meltwater runoff and mass loss associated with the retreat of marine-terminating outlet glaciers. In this paper we use a large ensemble of Greenland ice sheet models forced by output from a representative subset of CMIP5 global climate models to project ice sheet changes and sea-level rise contributions over the 21st century. The simulations are part of the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6 (ISMIP6). We estimate the sea-level contribution together with uncertainties due to future climate forcing, ice sheet model formulations and ocean forcing for the two greenhouse gas concentration scenarios RCP8.5 and RCP2.6. The results indicate that the Greenland ice sheet will continue to lose mass in both scenarios until 2100 with contributions of 89 ± 51 mm and 31 ± 16 mm to sea-level rise for RCP8.5 and RCP2.6, respectively. The largest mass loss is expected from the southwest of Greenland, which is governed by surface mass balance changes, continuing what is already observed today. Because the contributions are calculated against a unforced control experiment, these numbers do not include any committed mass loss, i.e. mass loss that would occur over the coming century if the climate forcing remained constant. Under RCP8.5 forcing, ice sheet model uncertainty explains an ensemble spread of 40 mm, while climate model uncertainty and ocean forcing uncertainty account for a spread of 36 mm and 19 mm, respectively. Apart from those formally derived uncertainty ranges, the largest gap in our knowledge is about the physical understanding and implementation of the calving process, i.e. the interaction of the ice sheet with the ocean.</p>

Estimating Greenland tidewater glacier retreat driven by submarine melting, The Cryosphere, 13, 2489–2509, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2489-2019, 2019.<br>Abstract<br>The effect of the North Atlantic Ocean on the Greenland Ice Sheet through submarine melting of Greenland's tidewater glacier calving fronts is thought to be a key driver of widespread glacier retreat, dynamic mass loss and sea level contribution from the ice sheet. Despite its critical importance, problems of process complexity and scale hinder efforts to represent the influence of submarine melting in ice-sheet-scale models. Here we propose parameterizing tidewater glacier terminus position as a simple linear function of submarine melting, with submarine melting in turn estimated as a function of subglacial discharge and ocean temperature. The relationship is tested, calibrated and validated using datasets of terminus position, subglacial discharge and ocean temperature covering the full ice sheet and surrounding ocean from the period 1960–2018. We demonstrate a statistically significant link between multi-decadal tidewater glacier terminus position change and submarine melting and show that the proposed parameterization has predictive power when considering a population of glaciers. An illustrative 21st century projection is considered, suggesting that tidewater glaciers in Greenland will undergo little further retreat in a low-emission RCP2.6 scenario. In contrast, a high-emission RCP8.5 scenario results in a median retreat of 4.2 km, with a quarter of tidewater glaciers experiencing retreat exceeding 10 km. Our study provides a long-term and ice-sheet-wide assessment of the sensitivity of tidewater glaciers to submarine melting and proposes a practical and empirically validated means of incorporating ocean forcing into models of the Greenland ice sheet.</p>

CMIP5 model selection for ISMIP6 ice sheet model forcing: Greenland and Antarctica, The Cryosphere, 14, 855–879, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-855-2020, 2020.<br>Abstract<br>The ice sheet model intercomparison project for CMIP6 (ISMIP6) effort brings together the ice sheet and climate modeling communities to gain understanding of the ice sheet contribution to sea level rise. ISMIP6 conducts stand-alone ice sheet experiments that use space- and time-varying forcing derived from atmosphere–ocean coupled global climate models (AOGCMs) to reflect plausible trajectories for climate projections. The goal of this study is to recommend a subset of CMIP5 AOGCMs (three core and three targeted) to produce forcing for ISMIP6 stand-alone ice sheet simulations, based on (i) their representation of current climate near Antarctica and Greenland relative to observations and (ii) their ability to sample a diversity of projected atmosphere and ocean changes over the 21st century. The selection is performed separately for Greenland and Antarctica. Model evaluation over the historical period focuses on variables used to generate ice sheet forcing. For stage (i), we combine metrics of atmosphere and surface ocean state (annual- and seasonal-mean variables over large spatial domains) with metrics of time-mean subsurface ocean temperature biases averaged over sectors of the continental shelf. For stage (ii), we maximize the diversity of climate projections among the best-performing models. Model selection is also constrained by technical limitations, such as availability of required data from RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 projections. The selected top three CMIP5 climate models are CCSM4, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, and NorESM1-M for Antarctica and HadGEM2-ES, MIROC5, and NorESM1-M for Greenland. This model selection was designed specifically for ISMIP6 but can be adapted for other applications.</p>

Twenty-first century ocean forcing of the Greenland ice sheet for modelling of sea level contribution , The Cryosphere, 14, 985–1008, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-985-2020, 2020.<br>Abstract<br>Changes in ocean temperature and salinity are expected to be an important determinant of the Greenland ice sheet's future sea level contribution. Yet, simulating the impact of these changes in continental-scale ice sheet models remains challenging due to the small scale of key physics, such as fjord circulation and plume dynamics, and poor understanding of critical processes, such as calving and submarine melting. Here we present the ocean forcing strategy for Greenland ice sheet models taking part in the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6 (ISMIP6), the primary community effort to provide 21st century sea level projections for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report. Beginning from global atmosphere–ocean general circulation models, we describe two complementary approaches to provide ocean boundary conditions for Greenland ice sheet models, termed the “retreat” and “submarine melt” implementations. The retreat implementation parameterises glacier retreat as a function of projected subglacial discharge and ocean thermal forcing, is designed to be implementable by all ice sheet models and results in retreat of around 1 and 15 km by 2100 in RCP2.6 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively. The submarine melt implementation provides estimated submarine melting only, leaving the ice sheet model to solve for the resulting calving and glacier retreat and suggests submarine melt rates will change little under RCP2.6 but will approximately triple by 2100 under RCP8.5. Both implementations have necessarily made use of simplifying assumptions and poorly constrained parameterisations and, as such, further research on submarine melting, calving and fjord–shelf exchange should remain a priority. Nevertheless, the presented framework will allow an ensemble of Greenland ice sheet models to be systematically and consistently forced by the ocean for the first time and should result in a significant improvement in projections of the Greenland ice sheet's contribution to future sea level change.</p>
<p><br>Jourdain et al. A protocol for calculating basal melt rates in the ISMIP6 Antarctic ice sheet projections, The Cryosphere Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2019-277, in review, 2019.<br>Abstract<br>Climate model projections have previously been used to compute ice-shelf basal melt rates in ice-sheet models, but the strategies employed – e.g. ocean input, parameterization, calibration technique, and corrections – have varied widely and are often ad-hoc. Here, a methodology is proposed for the calculation of circum-Antarctic basal melt rates for floating ice, based on climate models, that is suitable for ISMIP6, the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6 (6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project). The past and future evolution of ocean temperature and salinity is derived from a climate model by estimating anomalies with respect to the modern day, which are added to an present-day climatology constructed from existing observational datasets. Temperature and salinity are extrapolated to any position potentially occupied by a simulated ice shelf. A simple formulation is proposed for a basal-melt parameterization in ISMIP6, constrained by the observed temperature climatology, with a quadratic dependency on either the non-local or local thermal forcing. Two calibration methods are proposed: 1) based on the mean Antarctic melt rate (MeanAnt) and 2) based on melt rates near Pine Island's deep grounding line (PIGL). Future Antarctic mean melt rates are an order of magnitude greater in PIGL than in MeanAnt. The PIGL calibration, and the local parameterization, result in more realistic melt rates near grounding lines. PIGL is also more consistent with observations of interannual melt rate variability underneath Pine Island and Dotson ice shelves. This work stresses the need for more physics and less calibration in the parameterizations, and for more observations of hydrographic properties and melt rates at interannual and decadal time scales.</p>

This paper describes the experimental setup for process-based sea level change projections to be performed with stand-alone Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet models in the context of ISMIP6. The ISMIP6 protocol relies on a suite of polar atmospheric and oceanic CMIP-based forcing for ice sheet models, in order to explore the uncertainty in projected sea level change due to future emissions scenarios, CMIP models, ice sheet models, and parameterizations for ice–ocean interactions. We describe here the approach taken for defining the suite of ISMIP6 stand-alone ice sheet simulations, document the experimental framework and implementation, and present an overview of the ISMIP6 forcing to be used by participating ice sheet modeling groups.</p>

Remapping of Greenland ice sheet surface mass balance anomalies for large ensemble sea-level change projections, The Cryosphere, 14, 1747–1762, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1747-2020, 2020.<br>Abstract<br>Future sea-level change projections with process-based stand-alone ice sheet models are typically driven with surface mass balance (SMB) forcing derived from climate models. In this work we address the problems arising from a mismatch of the modelled ice sheet geometry with the geometry used by the climate model. We present a method for applying SMB forcing from climate models to a wide range of Greenland ice sheet models with varying and temporally evolving geometries. In order to achieve that, we translate a given SMB anomaly field as a function of absolute location to a function of surface elevation for 25 regional drainage basins, which can then be applied to different modelled ice sheet geometries. The key feature of the approach is the non-locality of this remapping process. The method reproduces the original forcing data closely when remapped to the original geometry. When remapped to different modelled geometries it produces a physically meaningful forcing with smooth and continuous SMB anomalies across basin divides. The method considerably reduces non-physical biases that would arise by applying the SMB anomaly derived for the climate model geometry directly to a large range of modelled ice sheet model geometries.</p><p></p>

&lt;p&gt;The abstract follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier large-scale Greenland ice sheet sea-level projections (e.g. those run during the ice2sea and SeaRISE initiatives) have shown that ice sheet initial conditions have a large effect on the projections and give rise to important uncertainties. The goal of this initMIP-Greenland intercomparison exercise is to compare, evaluate, and improve the initialisation techniques used in the ice sheet modelling community and to estimate the associated uncertainties in modelled mass changes. initMIP-Greenland is the first in a series of ice sheet model intercomparison activities within&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-429&quot;&gt;ISMIP6&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;(the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-305&quot;&gt;CMIP6&lt;/abbr&gt;), which is the primary activity within the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-305&quot;&gt;CMIP6&lt;/abbr&gt;) focusing on the ice sheets. Two experiments for the large-scale Greenland ice sheet have been designed to allow intercomparison between participating models of (1)&amp;nbsp;the initial present-day state of the ice sheet and (2)&amp;nbsp;the response in two idealised forward experiments. The forward experiments serve to evaluate the initialisation in terms of model drift (forward run without additional forcing) and in response to a large perturbation (prescribed surface mass balance anomaly); they should not be interpreted as sea-level projections. We present and discuss results that highlight the diversity of data sets, boundary conditions, and initialisation techniques used in the community to generate initial states of the Greenland ice sheet. We find good agreement across the ensemble for the dynamic response to surface mass balance changes in areas where the simulated ice sheets overlap but differences arising from the initial size of the ice sheet. The model drift in the control experiment is reduced for models that participated in earlier intercomparison exercises.&lt;/p&gt;" data-action-deadline="" data-action-completed="9/27/2018" data-action-contacts="[{&quot;id&quot;:279,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Christine Mataya&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:&quot;/members/people/286&quot;}]">

Observational datasets of Greenland Ice Sheet change are rapidly expanding and have been used for calibration and validation of ice sheet models. But substantial data-model gaps remain due to the knowledge barrier of understanding and using satellite- and paleo-data and the lack of a standard framework for using available observational datasets in ice sheet modeling experiments. There is significant potential to generate a long-lasting cyberinfrastructure framework with ice sheet data, software tools, online cloud-based execution and educational materials. When combined, this would lead to rapid progress in improving ice sheet modeling capability and decreasing uncertainty in sea level rise forecasting. The PIs will bring together experts in ice sheet observation, data analysis and modeling to guide the creation of a community hub that will enable two-way communication between data generators and modelers.

Ice flow models of the Antarctic ice sheet are commonly used to simulate its future evolution in response to different climate scenarios and inform on the mass loss that would contribute to future sea level rise. However, there is currently no consensus on estimated the future mass balance of the ice sheet, primarily because of differences in the representation of physical processes and the forcings employed. This study presents results from 18 simulations from 15 international groups focusing on the evolution of the Antarctic ice sheet during the period 2015&ndash;2100, forced with different scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) representative of the spread in climate model results. The contribution of the Antarctic ice sheet in response to increased warming during this period varies between &minus;7.8 and 30.0&thinsp;cm of Sea Level Equivalent (SLE). The evolution of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet varies widely among models, with an overall mass loss up to 21.0&thinsp;cm SLE in response to changes in oceanic conditions. East Antarctica mass change varies between &minus;6.5 and 16.5&thinsp;cm SLE, with a significant increase in surface mass balance outweighing the increased ice discharge under most RCP 8.5 scenario forcings. The inclusion of ice shelf collapse, here assumed to be caused by large amounts of liquid water ponding at the surface of ice shelves, yields an additional mass loss of 8&thinsp;mm compared to simulations without ice shelf collapse. The largest sources of uncertainty come from the ocean-induced melt rates, the calibration of these melt rates based on oceanic conditions taken outside of ice shelf cavities and the ice sheet dynamic response to these oceanic changes. Results under RCP 2.6 scenario based on two CMIP5 AOGCMs show an overall mass loss of 10&thinsp;mm SLE compared to simulations done under present-day conditions, with limited mass gain in East Antarctica.</p>\r\n<p><br />Goelzer et al. The future sea-level contribution of the Greenland ice sheet: a multi-model ensemble study of ISMIP6, The Cryosphere Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2019-319, in review, 2020.<br />Abstract. The Greenland ice sheet is one of the largest contributors to global-mean sea-level rise today and is expected to continue to lose mass as the Arctic continues to warm. The two predominant mass loss mechanisms are increased surface meltwater runoff and mass loss associated with the retreat of marine-terminating outlet glaciers. In this paper we use a large ensemble of Greenland ice sheet models forced by output from a representative subset of CMIP5 global climate models to project ice sheet changes and sea-level rise contributions over the 21st century. The simulations are part of the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6 (ISMIP6). We estimate the sea-level contribution together with uncertainties due to future climate forcing, ice sheet model formulations and ocean forcing for the two greenhouse gas concentration scenarios RCP8.5 and RCP2.6. The results indicate that the Greenland ice sheet will continue to lose mass in both scenarios until 2100 with contributions of 89&thinsp;&plusmn;&thinsp;51&thinsp;mm and 31&thinsp;&plusmn;&thinsp;16&thinsp;mm to sea-level rise for RCP8.5 and RCP2.6, respectively. The largest mass loss is expected from the southwest of Greenland, which is governed by surface mass balance changes, continuing what is already observed today. Because the contributions are calculated against a unforced control experiment, these numbers do not include any committed mass loss, i.e. mass loss that would occur over the coming century if the climate forcing remained constant. Under RCP8.5 forcing, ice sheet model uncertainty explains an ensemble spread of 40&thinsp;mm, while climate model uncertainty and ocean forcing uncertainty account for a spread of 36&thinsp;mm and 19&thinsp;mm, respectively. Apart from those formally derived uncertainty ranges, the largest gap in our knowledge is about the physical understanding and implementation of the calving process, i.e. the interaction of the ice sheet with the ocean.</p>\r\n<p>Slater et al. Estimating Greenland tidewater glacier retreat driven by submarine melting, The Cryosphere, 13, 2489&ndash;2509, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2489-2019, 2019.<br />Abstract<br />The effect of the North Atlantic Ocean on the Greenland Ice Sheet through submarine melting of Greenland's tidewater glacier calving fronts is thought to be a key driver of widespread glacier retreat, dynamic mass loss and sea level contribution from the ice sheet. Despite its critical importance, problems of process complexity and scale hinder efforts to represent the influence of submarine melting in ice-sheet-scale models. Here we propose parameterizing tidewater glacier terminus position as a simple linear function of submarine melting, with submarine melting in turn estimated as a function of subglacial discharge and ocean temperature. The relationship is tested, calibrated and validated using datasets of terminus position, subglacial discharge and ocean temperature covering the full ice sheet and surrounding ocean from the period 1960&ndash;2018. We demonstrate a statistically significant link between multi-decadal tidewater glacier terminus position change and submarine melting and show that the proposed parameterization has predictive power when considering a population of glaciers. An illustrative 21st century projection is considered, suggesting that tidewater glaciers in Greenland will undergo little further retreat in a low-emission RCP2.6 scenario. In contrast, a high-emission RCP8.5 scenario results in a median retreat of 4.2&thinsp;km, with a quarter of tidewater glaciers experiencing retreat exceeding 10&thinsp;km. Our study provides a long-term and ice-sheet-wide assessment of the sensitivity of tidewater glaciers to submarine melting and proposes a practical and empirically validated means of incorporating ocean forcing into models of the Greenland ice sheet.</p>\r\n<p><br />Barthel et al.

ISMIP6 conducts stand-alone ice sheet experiments that use space- and time-varying forcing derived from atmosphere&ndash;ocean coupled global climate models (AOGCMs) to reflect plausible trajectories for climate projections. The goal of this study is to recommend a subset of CMIP5 AOGCMs (three core and three targeted) to produce forcing for ISMIP6 stand-alone ice sheet simulations, based on (i) their representation of current climate near Antarctica and Greenland relative to observations and (ii) their ability to sample a diversity of projected atmosphere and ocean changes over the 21st century. The selection is performed separately for Greenland and Antarctica. Model evaluation over the historical period focuses on variables used to generate ice sheet forcing.

Model selection is also constrained by technical limitations, such as availability of required data from RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 projections. The selected top three CMIP5 climate models are CCSM4, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, and NorESM1-M for Antarctica and HadGEM2-ES, MIROC5, and NorESM1-M for Greenland.

Yet, simulating the impact of these changes in continental-scale ice sheet models remains challenging due to the small scale of key physics, such as fjord circulation and plume dynamics, and poor understanding of critical processes, such as calving and submarine melting. Here we present the ocean forcing strategy for Greenland ice sheet models taking part in the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6 (ISMIP6), the primary community effort to provide 21st century sea level projections for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report. Beginning from global atmosphere&ndash;ocean general circulation models, we describe two complementary approaches to provide ocean boundary conditions for Greenland ice sheet models, termed the &ldquo;retreat&rdquo; and &ldquo;submarine melt&rdquo; implementations. The retreat implementation parameterises glacier retreat as a function of projected subglacial discharge and ocean thermal forcing, is designed to be implementable by all ice sheet models and results in retreat of around 1 and 15&thinsp;km by 2100 in RCP2.6 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively. The submarine melt implementation provides estimated submarine melting only, leaving the ice sheet model to solve for the resulting calving and glacier retreat and suggests submarine melt rates will change little under RCP2.6 but will approximately triple by 2100 under RCP8.5. Both implementations have necessarily made use of simplifying assumptions and poorly constrained parameterisations and, as such, further research on submarine melting, calving and fjord&ndash;shelf exchange should remain a priority. Nevertheless, the presented framework will allow an ensemble of Greenland ice sheet models to be systematically and consistently forced by the ocean for the first time and should result in a significant improvement in projections of the Greenland ice sheet's contribution to future sea level change.</p>\r\n<p><br />Jourdain et al. A protocol for calculating basal melt rates in the ISMIP6 Antarctic ice sheet projections, The Cryosphere Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2019-277, in review, 2019.<br />Abstract<br />Climate model projections have previously been used to compute ice-shelf basal melt rates in ice-sheet models, but the strategies employed &ndash; e.g. ocean input, parameterization, calibration technique, and corrections &ndash; have varied widely and are often ad-hoc. Here, a methodology is proposed for the calculation of circum-Antarctic basal melt rates for floating ice, based on climate models, that is suitable for ISMIP6, the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6 (6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project). The past and future evolution of ocean temperature and salinity is derived from a climate model by estimating anomalies with respect to the modern day, which are added to an present-day climatology constructed from existing observational datasets. Temperature and salinity are extrapolated to any position potentially occupied by a simulated ice shelf. A simple formulation is proposed for a basal-melt parameterization in ISMIP6, constrained by the observed temperature climatology, with a quadratic dependency on either the non-local or local thermal forcing. Two calibration methods are proposed: 1) based on the mean Antarctic melt rate (MeanAnt) and 2) based on melt rates near Pine Island's deep grounding line (PIGL). Future Antarctic mean melt rates are an order of magnitude greater in PIGL than in MeanAnt. The PIGL calibration, and the local parameterization, result in more realistic melt rates near grounding lines. PIGL is also more consistent with observations of interannual melt rate variability underneath Pine Island and Dotson ice shelves. This work stresses the need for more physics and less calibration in the parameterizations, and for more observations of hydrographic properties and melt rates at interannual and decadal time scales.</p>\r\n<p><br />Nowicki et al.

In this work we address the problems arising from a mismatch of the modelled ice sheet geometry with the geometry used by the climate model. We present a method for applying SMB forcing from climate models to a wide range of Greenland ice sheet models with varying and temporally evolving geometries. In order to achieve that, we translate a given SMB anomaly field as a function of absolute location to a function of surface elevation for 25 regional drainage basins, which can then be applied to different modelled ice sheet geometries. The key feature of the approach is the non-locality of this remapping process. The method reproduces the original forcing data closely when remapped to the original geometry. When remapped to different modelled geometries it produces a physically meaningful forcing with smooth and continuous SMB anomalies across basin divides.

There is significant potential to generate a long-lasting cyberinfrastructure framework with ice sheet data, software tools, online cloud-based execution and educational materials. When combined, this would lead to rapid progress in improving ice sheet modeling capability and decreasing uncertainty in sea level rise forecasting. The PIs will bring together experts in ice sheet observation, data analysis and modeling to guide the creation of a community hub that will enable two-way communication between data generators and modelers.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Topic:&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;AIS Data - Arctic Data Collaboration Sub-Team May 2020 Meeting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Presentations:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sebastian Carisio is a Lead Technical Cartographic Analyst in the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency&#39;s Maritime Safety Office and talked about Arctic Spatial Data Infrastructure&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Technology, policy, and arrangements that give access to marine spatial data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;FAIR data principles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Facilitate broader user access and usage of the data provided&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Marin Kress is a Research Physical Scientist at the US Army Corps of Engineers and talked about the ACEAIS Analysis Package&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;NAIS information includes vessel identification, location, time stamp, speed etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;AIS is not available on every vessel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other data portals: SeaVision (USDOT) access to Satellite AIS data to government personnel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Captain Ed Page is a retired Coast Guard Officer and is Executive Director of Marine Exchange of Alaska talked about local community benefits of access to AIS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;International Maritime Organization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bering Strait Vessel Transit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vessel traffic is increasing from 262 to 477 between 2009 and 2019 through the Bering Strait&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Highlights:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;This meeting focused on expanding on the Arctic Data Team&amp;rsquo;s practitioner engagement on the cross-cutting issue &amp;ldquo;Exploring local Arctic community benefits of Automatic Information System (AIS)&amp;rdquo;, or ship tracking data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;The objective of this short meeting is to spark interest in continuing the conversation on this topic at&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-118&quot;&gt;IARPC&lt;/abbr&gt;, perhaps expanding on it in future calls, panels, or workshops.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Enhanced engagement with other collaboration teams.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Highlights:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;Jonathan Blythe (BOEM) gave an overview of data strategy and data management planning, which has traditionally focused on project level data management to catalogue, manage, finalize, and archive project data. There is a need in the earth sciences community to develop a data strategy at a higher level.&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

<li><em>Topic:&nbsp;</em>Data Management Strategy</li>
<li><em>Presentations:</em>
<ul>
<li>Primer on data strategy and planning</li>
<li>Briefing on Federal Data Strategy Action Plan</li>
<li>Quick overview of recent federal mandates and legislation (Evidence Act, Geospatial Data Act, Improving IQA, and various departmental directives)</li>
<li>ADCT&nbsp;Roadmap</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Highlights:&nbsp;</em>Jonathan Blythe (BOEM) gave an overview of data strategy and data management planning, which has traditionally focused on project level data management to catalogue, manage, finalize, and archive project data. There is a need in the earth sciences community to develop a data strategy at a higher level.<em><br></em></li>

<li>NSF&nbsp;has a recent Dear Colleague letter (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2019/nsf19069/nsf19069.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2019/nsf19069/nsf19069.jsp</a>) focusing on effective practises for data (this might apply more to data policy and data governance versus data strategy).</li>
<li>Data strategy and governance are two different areas for assessment:&nbsp;<a href="https://cmmiinstitute.com/data-management-maturity">https://cmmiinstitute.com/data-management-maturity</a>). Data governance (which includes data policy) as a future topic.</li>

Over the course of this two year cross-NCEI pilot project, the team compiled representative geospatial data sets from the Center for Weather and Climate (CWC) and Center for Coasts and Oceans (CCOG) that can be simultaneously selected and displayed in the Arctic-centric map viewer. This project demonstrated the integration of datasets hosted using disparate software including ArcGIS Server, GeoServer, and THREDDS. By employing standards-compliant services, non-NCEI organizations can easily ingest the NCEI services into their own viewers, enhancing their own products and increasing exposure to NCEI data.

Through this initial effort, the team identified compatibility issues and solutions, and explored ways to informatively display diverse data types, which will guide the ways in which we make our data useful and available to users. We also continue our collaboration with the Southern Ocean Observing System to identify in-situ Southern Ocean data at risk of loss and work with the PIs and project staff to convert it to standard formats (CF-compliant netCDF) with complete ISO-19115-2 metadata, archive it at NCEI, and make it discoverable and downloadable through our Geoportal and web services. SOOS will federate this data into their SOOSmap application for discovery and re-use, and it may be added to other services. This work was supported by the NOAA Big Earth Data Initiative (BEDI).

Over the course of this two year cross-NCEI pilot project, the team compiled representative geospatial data sets from the Center for Weather and Climate (CWC) and Center for Coasts and Oceans (CCOG) that can be simultaneously selected and displayed in the Arctic-centric map viewer. This project demonstrated the integration of datasets hosted using disparate software including ArcGIS Server, GeoServer, and THREDDS. By employing standards-compliant services, non-NCEI organizations can easily ingest the NCEI services into their own viewers, enhancing their own products and increasing exposure to NCEI data.

Through this initial effort, the team identified compatibility issues and solutions, and explored ways to informatively display diverse data types, which will guide the ways in which we make our data useful and available to users. We also continue our collaboration with the Southern Ocean Observing System to identify in-situ Southern Ocean data at risk of loss and work with the PIs and project staff to convert it to standard formats (CF-compliant netCDF) with complete ISO-19115-2 metadata, archive it at NCEI, and make it discoverable and downloadable through our Geoportal and web services. SOOS will federate this data into their SOOSmap application for discovery and re-use, and it may be added to other services. This work was supported by the NOAA Big Earth Data Initiative (BEDI). We're also continuing our work with the NSF Arctic Data Center and the DataOne network, which is in the tool-building phase to facilitate data transfer from the network to NCEI for long-term archival.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Abstract: Land cover maps are the basic data layer required for understanding and modeling ecological patterns and processes. The Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map (CAVM), produced in 2003, has been widely used as a base map for studies in the arctic tundra biome. However, the relatively coarse resolution and vector format of the map were not compatible with many other data sets. We present a new version of the CAVM, building on the strengths of the original map, while providing a finer spatial resolution, raster format, and improved mapping. The Raster CAVM uses the legend, extent and projection of the original CAVM. The legend has 16 vegetation types, glacier, saline water, freshwater, and non-arctic land. The Raster CAVM divides the original rock-water-vegetation complex map unit that mapped the Canadian Shield into two map units, distinguishing between areas with lichen- and shrub-dominated vegetation. In contrast to the original hand-drawn CAVM, the new map is based on unsupervised classifications of seventeen geographic/floristic sub-sections of the Arctic, using AVHRR and MODIS data (reflectance and NDVI) and elevation data. The units resulting from the classification were modeled to the CAVM types using a wide variety of ancillary data. The map was reviewed by experts familiar with their particular region, including many of the original authors of the CAVM from Canada, Greenland (Denmark), Iceland, Norway (including Svalbard), Russia, and the U.S. The analysis presented here summarizes the area, geographical distribution, elevation, summer temperatures, and NDVI of the map units. The greater spatial resolution of the Raster CAVM allowed more detailed mapping of water-bodies and mountainous areas. It portrays coastal-inland gradients, and better reflects the heterogeneity of vegetation type distribution than the original CAVM. Accuracy assessment of random 1-km pixels interpreted from 6 Landsat scenes showed an average of 70% accuracy, up from 39% for the original CAVM. The distribution of shrub-dominated types changed the most, with more prostrate shrub tundra mapped in mountainous areas, and less low shrub tundra in lowland areas. This improved mapping is important for quantifying existing and potential changes to land cover, a key environmental indicator for modeling and monitoring ecosystems.

Remote Sensing of Environment. 232, 111297. doi: 10.1016/j.rse.2019.111297<br />Abstract: Land cover maps are the basic data layer required for understanding and modeling ecological patterns and processes. The Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map (CAVM), produced in 2003, has been widely used as a base map for studies in the arctic tundra biome. However, the relatively coarse resolution and vector format of the map were not compatible with many other data sets. We present a new version of the CAVM, building on the strengths of the original map, while providing a finer spatial resolution, raster format, and improved mapping. The Raster CAVM uses the legend, extent and projection of the original CAVM. The legend has 16 vegetation types, glacier, saline water, freshwater, and non-arctic land. The Raster CAVM divides the original rock-water-vegetation complex map unit that mapped the Canadian Shield into two map units, distinguishing between areas with lichen- and shrub-dominated vegetation. In contrast to the original hand-drawn CAVM, the new map is based on unsupervised classifications of seventeen geographic/floristic sub-sections of the Arctic, using AVHRR and MODIS data (reflectance and NDVI) and elevation data. The units resulting from the classification were modeled to the CAVM types using a wide variety of ancillary data. The map was reviewed by experts familiar with their particular region, including many of the original authors of the CAVM from Canada, Greenland (Denmark), Iceland, Norway (including Svalbard), Russia, and the U.S. The analysis presented here summarizes the area, geographical distribution, elevation, summer temperatures, and NDVI of the map units. The greater spatial resolution of the Raster CAVM allowed more detailed mapping of water-bodies and mountainous areas. It portrays coastal-inland gradients, and better reflects the heterogeneity of vegetation type distribution than the original CAVM. Accuracy assessment of random 1-km pixels interpreted from 6 Landsat scenes showed an average of 70% accuracy, up from 39% for the original CAVM. The distribution of shrub-dominated types changed the most, with more prostrate shrub tundra mapped in mountainous areas, and less low shrub tundra in lowland areas. This improved mapping is important for quantifying existing and potential changes to land cover, a key environmental indicator for modeling and monitoring ecosystems. The final product is publicly available at www.geobotany.uaf.edu and at Mendeley Data, DOI: 10.17632/c4xj5rv6kv.1.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"","completed":"","followupvalue":"","id":2547,"users":[],"followup":null},{"milestone":275,"editable":false,"type":"outstanding","typeclass":"outstanding","date":"February 8, 2021","shortdate":"2/8/2021","datevalue":"20210208","action":"<p><span>The Arctic Regional Marine Spatial Data Infrastructures Working Group (ARMSDIWG), under the Arctic Regional Hydrographic Commission (ARHC) [</span><a class=\"waffle-rich-text-link\" href=\"https://iho.int/en/arctic-rhc\">https://iho.int/en/arctic-rhc</a><span>], is the key coordinating body for the deliverability of marine geospatial data from Arctic HOs to a broader user base.

Remote Sensing of Environment. 232, 111297. doi: 10.1016/j.rse.2019.111297</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Abstract: Land cover maps are the basic data layer required for understanding and modeling ecological patterns and processes. The Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map (CAVM), produced in 2003, has been widely used as a base map for studies in the arctic tundra biome. However, the relatively coarse resolution and vector format of the map were not compatible with many other data sets. We present a new version of the CAVM, building on the strengths of the original map, while providing a finer spatial resolution, raster format, and improved mapping. The Raster CAVM uses the legend, extent and projection of the original CAVM. The legend has 16 vegetation types, glacier, saline water, freshwater, and non-arctic land. The Raster CAVM divides the original rock-water-vegetation complex map unit that mapped the Canadian Shield into two map units, distinguishing between areas with lichen- and shrub-dominated vegetation. In contrast to the original hand-drawn CAVM, the new map is based on unsupervised classifications of seventeen geographic/floristic sub-sections of the Arctic, using AVHRR and MODIS data (reflectance and NDVI) and elevation data. The units resulting from the classification were modeled to the CAVM types using a wide variety of ancillary data. The map was reviewed by experts familiar with their particular region, including many of the original authors of the CAVM from Canada, Greenland (Denmark), Iceland, Norway (including Svalbard), Russia, and the U.S. The analysis presented here summarizes the area, geographical distribution, elevation, summer temperatures, and NDVI of the map units. The greater spatial resolution of the Raster CAVM allowed more detailed mapping of water-bodies and mountainous areas. It portrays coastal-inland gradients, and better reflects the heterogeneity of vegetation type distribution than the original CAVM. Accuracy assessment of random 1-km pixels interpreted from 6 Landsat scenes showed an average of 70% accuracy, up from 39% for the original CAVM. The distribution of shrub-dominated types changed the most, with more prostrate shrub tundra mapped in mountainous areas, and less low shrub tundra in lowland areas. This improved mapping is important for quantifying existing and potential changes to land cover, a key environmental indicator for modeling and monitoring ecosystems. The final product is publicly available at www.geobotany.uaf.edu and at Mendeley Data, DOI: 10.17632/c4xj5rv6kv.1.</span></p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"","completed":"","followupvalue":"","id":2748,"users":[{"id":279,"name":"Christine Mataya","link":"/members/people/286"}],"followup":null}];

The ideas are intended to help shape future planning efforts and ultimately funding opportunities as they become available.</span></p><p></p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Goals of Meeting:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community round table discussion around the record low ice conditions in the Bering Sea Ice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine how the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;IARPC&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Collaboration Teams can act together to facilitate community-wide interaction around major events (e.g., shaping research needs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine future actions based on discussion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outcomes:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compile what we know is happening now in the Bering and what we expect to happen and include local observations in that compilation. (This is centered on observations and modeling. I would add that we also need to do what John was talking about and compile what information/workshops/resources are out there and make them available in one place. Maybe an&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;ARCUS&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;task using in part the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;ARCUS&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;calendar? Once someone gets a spreadsheet set up, others could add to it.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up a working group to develop a system that duplicates the Bering Sea Executive Order. Joel Clement, Martin&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;and&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;ARCUS&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;expressed interest in working on this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coordinating cruises for the upcoming season. (The&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;EICT,&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;FOWG, and Renee&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Crain&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;have already taken the lead on this.

The conversation included researchers, Indigenous knowledge holders, resource managers, and policy makers, as well as other interested stakeholders. Participants shared their perspectives on two key questions: 1) What do you consider the most pressing marine research priority for the Bering Sea/Bering Strait and adjacent regions? and 2) What do you consider the most important data or information gap to fill? The organizers convened this open discussion to ensure that any new research efforts will coordinate to: 1) be responsive to local community concerns; 2) build upon the scientific foundations laid by previous studies; 3) complement current research efforts; and, 4) facilitate necessary research in the near-term to document the rapid changes underway while planning for longer-term research and monitoring efforts by multiple organizations. Organizers hosted a similar listening session at the 2020 Alaska Forum on the Environment. The organizers shared the ideas presented at these events in a short Executive Summary document. The ideas are intended to help shape future planning efforts and ultimately funding opportunities as they become available.</span></p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"11/13/2020","completed":"November 13, 2020","followupvalue":"20201113","id":2578,"users":[{"id":498,"name":"Candace Nachman","link":"/members/people/1320"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","November 13, 2020"]}},{"milestone":247,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"November 13, 2020","shortdate":"11/13/2020","datevalue":"20201113","action":"<p><span>A town hall was held at the February 2020 AGU Ocean Sciences meeting in San Diego, CA titled: </span><em>Scientific response to an ever faster changing Arctic: Making the most of our collective research efforts</em><span>.

The focus of the meeting was to foster awareness about the unprecedented rate of environmental change happening in the Arctic and the need for developing a framework that can address these issues. Dr. Cheryl Rosa (USARC), Molly McCammon (AOOS), and two researchers, Dr. Seth Danielson (UAF) and Dr. Jackie Grebmeier (University of Maryland Center for Environmental Studies), presented on recent trends in the Arctic highlighting the need for increased communication and collaboration among the research community.
