&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Words from Nikoosh Carlo: The Arctic Futures 2050 conference was is step in creating opportunities for stronger exchanges and honest dialogue moving forward. Spending time and effort in developing personal relationships in smaller groups and using a different type of space to get to that place where you have strong exchanges of information. Resources were an important topic and often determine power. How do you draw from different sources? How do you use these revenue streams to support communities? How can institutions and frameworks that are already existing be changed or adjusted so there is greater participation from indigenous representatives?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Where were the policy makers? This is somewhere we could grow more.

                <p></p><p>Seaweed/macroalgae is a foundational species and ecosystem engineer, providing habitat, nursery, forage grounds and refuge for migratory and coastal marine species. In Iceland, a coastal community also depends on the resource to thrive.&nbsp;To help inform the&nbsp;establishment of sustainable seaweed fisheries policy,&nbsp;a total biomass&nbsp;has been&nbsp;estimated by scientific methods. However, according to the local community, the harvestable biomass is very limited. This master’s thesis research focuses on understanding the connections between society and ecology surrounding rockweed; and documenting the local knowledge and observations of the seaweed harvesters and a local coastal community to inform policy for sustainable seaweed use. The results highlight the importance of continuous collaboration and co-production of knowledge between science and the local communities.

To move beyond the integration dilemma, we treat traditional knowledge and science as distinct and complementary knowledge systems. We focus on applying traditional knowledge within the decision-making process. We present succinct examples of how the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has used traditional knowledge in decision making in the North Slope Borough, Alaska: 1) using traditional knowledge in designing, planning, and conducting scientific research; 2) applying information from both knowledge systems at the earliest opportunity in the process; 3) using traditional knowledge in environmental impacts assessment; 4) consulting with indigenous leaders at key decision points; and 5) applying traditional knowledge at a programmatic decision level. Clearly articulating, early in the process, how best to use traditional knowledge and science can allow for more complete and inclusive use of available and pertinent information. <strong>Citation</strong>: Kendall, J.J. et al., 2017, Use of traditional knowledge by the United States Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to support resource management.

Wide-scale observations of freshwater ice and how its presence has changed over time will meet a fundamental need for a broad range of stakeholders, from rural communities that depend on ice for transportation and subsistence harvest, to industries that rely on winter water for ice road construction, to scientists studying climate change and ecosystem services.

&lt;li&gt;Community round table discussion around the record low ice conditions in the Bering Sea Ice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine how the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;IARPC&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Collaboration Teams can act together to facilitate community-wide interaction around major events (e.g., shaping research needs)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outcomes:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compile what we know is happening now in the Bering and what we expect to happen and include local observations in that compilation. (This is centered on observations and modeling. I would add that we also need to do what John was talking about and compile what information/workshops/resources are out there and make them available in one place.

Once someone gets a spreadsheet set up, others could add to it.)&lt;/li&gt;

The involvement of residents and institutions in Uummannaq at all stages of the project, in combination with ongoing observations, will lay the foundations for ongoing community support and enable new insights into the complex social, cultural and economic changes caused by rapid environmental change.</p><p></p>

A collaborative effort between the Yukon River Inter-Tribal Watershed Council (YRITWC) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the Indigenous Observation Network (ION) has developed two projects that focus on water quality and permafrost research. More than 300 community environmental technicians have been trained to participate in ION by effectively monitoring and investigating their local environments with global implications. These local observations, obtained over the past decade, have contributed to the global understanding of climate change and ultimately its impacts on Alaska Native Villages. Combined with historical data from the USGS, the ION database now covers over 30 years of historical water quality data in key locations. Trend analysis of this database suggests increased active layer expansion, weathering and sulfide oxidation due to permafrost degradation throughout the YRB. Changing geochemistry of the YRB may have important implications for the carbon cycle, aquatic ecosystems, and contaminant transport. With predicted environmental changes, the efforts of ION and the integration of Indigenous knowledge will become critical to assess, mitigate and adapt to changing local environments.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"","completed":"","followupvalue":"","id":1242,"users":[{"id":524,"name":"John Pearce","link":"/members/people/1446"}],"followup":null},{"milestone":242,"editable":false,"type":"outstanding","typeclass":"outstanding","date":"September 21, 2017","shortdate":"9/21/2017","datevalue":"20170921","action":"<p><strong>Scientists Establish Long-term Ecological Monitoring Sites in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta of Western Alaska</strong>: Scientists with USGS and US Forest Service installed remote, automated weather stations in the Tribal Villages of Chevak and Kotlik in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta of western Alaska as part of a growing network of long-term ecological monitoring sites established in this rapidly-changing region. The weather stations and monitoring sites, installed in collaboration with local scientists from the Chevak Traditional Council and the Kotlik Tribal Council, will be used by local villages to monitor changing environmental conditions relevant to subsistence activities.

Workshop participants ranging in age from 18 to 86 described observed landscape changes and identified the impacts of those changes to subsistence, health and safety, infrastructure, and the local economy. Additionally, participants identified the location of specific landscape changes such as erosion, permafrost thaw, and changing vegetation on maps. These workshops allow USGS researchers to document slow moving changes that cannot be identified through traditional methods as historical baseline data and imagery is sparse in this region. The findings from these workshops will enable researchers to investigate causes of landscape change and make recommendations to the Traditional Council and the community about anticipated future changes as well as identify gaps in existing data in order to implement future data gathering activities.

The extreme climatic conditions in the Arctic have allowed the preservation of organic structures and artifacts that can provide a glimpse into history and cannot be found elsewhere on Earth. However, many Arctic archeological sites, located nearshore, are threatened by coastal erosion due to reduction in sea ice cover, increased storm frequency, and melting permafrost. And both nearshore and inland sites are affected by the warmer temperatures that are accelerating the decomposition of organic structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the cultural importance for Indigenous Arctic communities, these sites are an important piece of mankind history, they tell the story of how humans spread from Asia to the Americas and the coasts of Greenland. Furthermore, these sites are home to large amounts of environmental, biological, climate and social/cultural data that could be useful to our understanding of the current world, particularly how people adapted to rapid environmental change in the past during the Little Ice Age or the Medieval Warm Period. The information gathered from the Arctic heritage sites can be used to design better resilience strategies for modern Arctic communities, and coastal communities globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indigenous heritage traverses multiple countries, thus preserving the sites requires international cooperation and close collaboration with local communities. The strategy to preserve the&amp;nbsp;historical information of the sites broadly falls into 2 categories: 1. Preserve sites and/or move artifacts or 2. Sample and study the sites before they disappear; this requires collaborations across agencies, with researchers and local communities. The National Science Foundation funds research to support both local and international efforts to investigate and protect archeological sites in high-risk coastal areas.

&lt;p&gt;Here, the researchers seek to rescue a large multi-component archaeological site dating to at least 1200 years ago, the Walakpa, or Ualiqpaa, site, from the rapidly eroding coastline. This site contains records of the migration and evolution of Birnirk and Thule cultures.&lt;/p&gt;

The extreme climatic conditions in the Arctic have allowed the preservation of organic structures and artifacts that can provide a glimpse into history and cannot be found elsewhere on Earth. However, many Arctic archeological sites, located nearshore, are threatened by coastal erosion due to reduction in sea ice cover, increased storm frequency, and melting permafrost. And both nearshore and inland sites are affected by the warmer temperatures that are accelerating the decomposition of organic structures.</p>\r\n<p>Beyond the cultural importance for Indigenous Arctic communities, these sites are an important piece of mankind history, they tell the story of how humans spread from Asia to the Americas and the coasts of Greenland. Furthermore, these sites are home to large amounts of environmental, biological, climate and social/cultural data that could be useful to our understanding of the current world, particularly how people adapted to rapid environmental change in the past during the Little Ice Age or the Medieval Warm Period. The information gathered from the Arctic heritage sites can be used to design better resilience strategies for modern Arctic communities, and coastal communities globally.</p>\r\n<p>Indigenous heritage traverses multiple countries, thus preserving the sites requires international cooperation and close collaboration with local communities. The strategy to preserve the&nbsp;historical information of the sites broadly falls into 2 categories: 1. Preserve sites and/or move artifacts or 2. Sample and study the sites before they disappear; this requires collaborations across agencies, with researchers and local communities. The National Science Foundation funds research to support both local and international efforts to investigate and protect archeological sites in high-risk coastal areas. Funds are granted through regular and Rapid Response Research (RAPID) awards. Below are examples of awards addressing the aforementioned issues:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Example 1. Comparative Island Ecodynamics in the North Atlantic (Award # 1449616)</strong></p>\r\n<p>The researchers seek to understand how differences in response to rapid environmental change of two closely related northern communities resulted in the collapse of one and survival of the other. Findings may help understand what makes a community resilient to environmental change and apply to current and/or future communities. https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1449616&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Example 2. RAPID: Walakpa Archeology Rapid Response Project (Award # 1646865)</strong></p>\r\n<p>Here, the researchers seek to rescue a large multi-component archaeological site dating to at least 1200 years ago, the Walakpa, or Ualiqpaa, site, from the rapidly eroding coastline. This site contains records of the migration and evolution of Birnirk and Thule cultures.</p>\r\n<p>https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1646865</p>\r\n<p><strong>Example 3. RAPID: Archeological Investigation at Iita (Award # 1623802)</strong></p>\r\n<p>This team of researcher is investigating the interactions between the Dorset and Thule (ancestor of the contemporary Inuit) people in the prehistoric Arctic at the threatened site of Iita in Greenland.</p>\r\n<p>https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1623802</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Example 4.

Both study areas lie within the zone of continuous permafrost, which exists both on and offshore and outcrops as ice-rich bluffs. We compared geomorphic changes over time to changes in sea-ice coverage, which declined ~10 days per decade between 1979 and 2016 in the southern Chukchi Sea.

                <p></p><p><strong>New Analysis of Pacific Walrus Demography</strong>: USGS Alaska Science Center researchers Rebecca Taylor, Mark Udevitz and Chadwick Jay collaborated with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Alaska Department of Fish and Game to synthesize information on Pacific walrus population sizes, age structures, reproductive rates, and harvests for 1974-2015. The walrus population underwent a multi-decade decline which began moderating in the 1990s.&nbsp; Reproduction and calf survival rose over time; however, juvenile survival may have decreased over time.&nbsp; Depending on whether juvenile survival decreased, the population growth rate either increased during the 2000s or stabilized at a lesser level of decline than seen in the 1980s.&nbsp; An early view of the paper is currently available at<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mms.12434/full">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mms.12434/full</a><span>&nbsp;</span>.&nbsp; (Contact:&nbsp; Rebecca Taylor, 907-786-7004, Anchorage, AK).</p>

The goal of the Seabirds Offshore Project was to conduct at-sea surveys in lease sale areas and adjacent ocean planning areas, to provide current temporal and spatial data on marine birds and mammals, and submit the data to the North Pacific Pelagic Seabird Database (NPPSD). During this project, 2010-2016, we placed seabird observers on 45 research and monitoring vessels, usually in association with multidisciplinary ecosystem projects. Because many of these cruises transited from southern Alaska ports, we included all surveyed routes in this report. We surveyed a total of 97,525 km, with the majority (31,497 km) in the Chukchi Sea, followed by the southern Bering Sea (30,265 km), northern Bering Sea (26,326 km) and Beaufort Sea (9,438 km). Our survey coverage extended from the northern GOA shelf to the eastern Aleutian Islands, north throughout the Bering Sea shelf, into the eastern Chukchi Sea, and the western Beaufort Sea shelf, including the Arctic Basin.

Through several collaborative projects, including on-going efforts, we have linked seabird survey data to oceanographic and prey data collected during concurrent cruises, and from remote sensing data. These efforts test hypotheses about the distribution of upper trophic level predators in response to changes in prey and ice cover.

Braund &amp; Associates (SRB&amp;A) to develop and implement a social indicator (SI) system which would provide baseline data on the well-being of residents on the North Slope of Alaska. The title of this study is Social Indicators in Coastal Alaska: Arctic Communities (SICAA). The scope of work for the study called for the identification of a set of SIs&mdash;variables which measure the well-being and life quality of a given population. These SIs&nbsp;were collected through a household survey in the six coastal North Slope communities (Point Hope, Point Lay, Wainwright, Utqiaġvik [formerly Barrow], Nuiqsut, and Kaktovik). Between January 8 and March 9, 2016, SRB&amp;A interviewed 684 randomly selected heads of household (HHs) in the selected North Slope communities. The purpose of the interviews was to develop a baseline understanding of the well-being of North Slope residents before major offshore oil and gas (O&amp;G) development activity. The interview, which took about an hour, used structured questions to measure SIs of well-being in seven domains: economic well-being, physical environment, health and safety, cultural continuity, education, local control, and overall well-being. The interview also included a suite of questions about the type, timing, cause, and appropriate mitigation action associated with any impacts of O&amp;G exploration and development on subsistence activities in the prior year.

Seabirds spend most of the year offshore, yet our data gaps are greatest for the pelagic aspect of their lives. The goal of the Seabirds Offshore Project was to conduct at-sea surveys in lease sale areas and adjacent ocean planning areas, to provide current temporal and spatial data on marine birds and mammals, and submit the data to the North Pacific Pelagic Seabird Database (NPPSD). During this project, 2010-2016, we placed seabird observers on 45 research and monitoring vessels, usually in association with multidisciplinary ecosystem projects. Because many of these cruises transited from southern Alaska ports, we included all surveyed routes in this report. We surveyed a total of 97,525 km, with the majority (31,497 km) in the Chukchi Sea, followed by the southern Bering Sea (30,265 km), northern Bering Sea (26,326 km) and Beaufort Sea (9,438 km). Our survey coverage extended from the northern GOA shelf to the eastern Aleutian Islands, north throughout the Bering Sea shelf, into the eastern Chukchi Sea, and the western Beaufort Sea shelf, including the Arctic Basin. The seabird survey data collected under the Seabirds Offshore Project has been included in over 30 presentations and 17 publications to date, as well as at least 12 public outreach and education venues and 7 websites. We have described seasonal distribution patterns of seabirds in offshore waters of Alaska, and identified &lsquo;hotspots&rsquo; of foraging and migration activity. Through several collaborative projects, including on-going efforts, we have linked seabird survey data to oceanographic and prey data collected during concurrent cruises, and from remote sensing data. These efforts test hypotheses about the distribution of upper trophic level predators in response to changes in prey and ice cover. All seabird data collected during this project has been submitted to the NPPSD, to the Alaska BOEM office, and to affiliated ecosystem projects (available via Alaska Ocean Observing System work spaces).

The data on energy allocation and feeding ecology presented in this paper fill a critical information gap in the Arctic-Yukon-Kuskokwim region of Alaska where salmon have undergone major changes in population trajectory and raised management concerns. This study provides the first examination of energy allocation of juvenile chum salmon during the critical life history period as fish transition from freshwater to saltwater and suggests that body growth is strongly favored over energy storage as lipids. Lipid storage during saltwater entry does not appear to be a prerequisite for survival to later life stages, given that the cohort of salmon examined contributed to a brief period of high survival and record adult returns to rivers.

&lt;li&gt;Report out from&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;HABs&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Workshop in Nome-Kayla&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Schommer&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;(Sea Grant/&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-34&quot;&gt;AOOS&lt;/abbr&gt;)&amp;nbsp;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The meeting posed the question &quot;How can the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-118&quot;&gt;IARPC&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;community and the many disciplines represented on this call work together to help answer basic science questions?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are possible links between sea ice and&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;HABs. The&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-212&quot;&gt;SICT&lt;/abbr&gt;leadership will pursue discussions around these possible links and help to make connections between researchers.&lt;/li&gt;

<p><span>The meeting posed the question "How can the<span>&nbsp;</span></span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-118">IARPC</abbr><span><span>&nbsp;</span>community and the many disciplines represented on this call work together to help answer basic science questions?"</span></p>
<ul>
<li>There are possible links between sea ice and<span>&nbsp;</span>HABs. The<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-212">SICT</abbr>leadership will pursue discussions around these possible links and help to make connections between researchers.</li>
<li>Danielle noted that the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-414">MECT</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-422">MST</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>are continuing discussions around advancing<span>&nbsp;</span>biogeochemical<span>&nbsp;</span>models.

                <p></p><p><span>USGS</span>&nbsp;Alaska Science Center scientist Vanessa&nbsp;<span>von</span>&nbsp;<span>Biela</span>&nbsp;led a&nbsp;<span>multi</span>-agency&nbsp;effort with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Alaska Department of Fish and Game, and the&nbsp;<span>USGS</span>&nbsp;<span>Leetown</span>&nbsp;and Western Ecological Research Science Centers to conduct an innovative study of heat stress&nbsp;<span>biomarkers</span>&nbsp;in the Yukon River watershed focused on Chinook salmon.&nbsp;Alaska's historically cool rivers, lakes, and oceans have a long history of producing Pacific salmon, but peak summer water temperatures now routinely exceed the 18 °C threshold&nbsp;associated&nbsp;with&nbsp;heat stress and increased premature mortality risk in Pacific salmon.&nbsp;About half of the Yukon River Chinook salmon captured in this study had&nbsp;evidence&nbsp;of heat stress based on a combination of&nbsp;gene transcription and heat shock protein&nbsp;<span>biomarkers</span>&nbsp;across six sites and two study years (2016–2017).&nbsp;This work is the first to demonstrate heat stress in the northern portion of the Pacific salmon range. The findings have immediate implications for management and research priorities given the likelihood that fishery escapement counts of spawning adults in some northern rivers likely include fish that will succumb to premature mortality and fail to spawn.&nbsp; C<span>ontact&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/vanessa-von-biela?qt-staff_profile_science_products=0#qt-staff_profile_science_products">Vanessa&nbsp;<span>von</span>&nbsp;<span>Biela</span></a>, Anchorage, Alaska, for more information.</span>&nbsp;</p>

The results suggest that ringed and bearded seal body condition and the phase of the winter Arctic Oscillation are important factors affecting feeding, body condition and recruitment. Although spring sea ice declined 2% per year during the study, reaching levels not previously observed in the satellite record, reduced access to prey doesn&rsquo;t yet appear to have significantly affected body condition or reproduction.

All genomic sequences from the virus shared 99% nucleotide identity with those of a wild bird strain from South Korea. This finding supports viral dispersal between East Asia and North America by wild birds. The virus was obtained as part of annual influenza A virus research and surveillance using samples collected from hunter-harvested ducks at the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge.

                <p></p><p class="x_MsoNormal"><span>In a new short report, scientists with the USGS Alaska Science Center and the University of Georgia document the genome sequence of a low pathogenic H6N5 influenza A virus isolated from a northern pintail sampled in Alaska in 2017. All genomic sequences from the virus shared 99% nucleotide identity with those of a wild bird strain from South Korea. This finding supports viral dispersal between East Asia and North America by wild birds. The virus was obtained as part of annual influenza A virus research and surveillance using samples collected from hunter-harvested ducks at the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. This&nbsp;is the second instance of nearly identical viruses identified at Izembek and wetlands in western South Korea.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>

The study assessed: 1) from which species viruses are consistently recovered, 2) the contribution of different avian hosts to viral diversity detected in the region, and 3) how evidence of intercontinental exchange of IAVs relates to different hosts. While overall viral diversity was similar among waterfowl, species with intercontinental migratory tendencies, such as northern pintails and emperor geese, exhibited greater evidence for viral exchange between continents. Glaucous-wing gulls maintained different viral diversity than other species sampled and also exhibited evidence for intercontinental viral exchange. Results from this study may be used to optimize sampling strategies at Izembek NWR and other locations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                <p></p><p><strong>New Publication and Data Release Evaluates Sampling Strategies for Avian Influenza Viruses at Izembek National Wildlife Refuge:&nbsp;</strong><span>In a study recently published in PLOS ONE, researchers at the USGS Alaska Science Center, USGS National Wildlife Health Center, and the University of Georgia analyzed genomic data for influenza A viruses (IAVs) sampled from waterfowl and gulls at Izembek National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) over five years. The study assessed: 1) from which species viruses are consistently recovered, 2) the contribution of different avian hosts to viral diversity detected in the region, and 3) how evidence of intercontinental exchange of IAVs relates to different hosts. While overall viral diversity was similar among waterfowl, species with intercontinental migratory tendencies, such as northern pintails and emperor geese, exhibited greater evidence for viral exchange between continents. Glaucous-wing gulls maintained different viral diversity than other species sampled and also exhibited evidence for intercontinental viral exchange. Results from this study may be used to optimize sampling strategies at Izembek NWR and other locations. </span></p>

The study assessed: 1) from which species viruses are consistently recovered, 2) the contribution of different avian hosts to viral diversity detected in the region, and 3) how evidence of intercontinental exchange of IAVs relates to different hosts. While overall viral diversity was similar among waterfowl, species with intercontinental migratory tendencies, such as northern pintails and emperor geese, exhibited greater evidence for viral exchange between continents. Glaucous-wing gulls maintained different viral diversity than other species sampled and also exhibited evidence for intercontinental viral exchange. Results from this study may be used to optimize sampling strategies at Izembek NWR and other locations. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><strong>Citation:</strong>&nbsp;</span>Reeves, A.B., Hall, J.S., Poulson, R.L., Donnelly, T., Stallknecht, D.E., Ramey A.M. 2018.

Blood parasites have been linked to health consequences in some birds, but possible impacts on eiders are unknown.&nbsp; Blood parasites in birds are not known to cause disease in people. Blood parasites were identified in 6.5% of adult Spectacled Eiders sampled on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta and Arctic Coastal Plain (ACP) of Alaska and 41.9% of juvenile eiders sampled on the ACP.

The Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska supports a diverse suite of species, including waterfowl that are common hosts of IAVs. Mammals co-occur with geese and other migratory waterbirds during the summer breeding season, thus providing a plausible mechanism for interspecies transmission of IAVs. The study found that although prevalence was relatively high in waterbirds on the Arctic Coastal Plain, antibodies to IAVs were rare among marine and terrestrial mammals. These results suggest that foxes, caribou, and polar bears in Arctic Alaska are not commonly exposed to IAVs and thus are unlikely to play an important role in their circulation in this region.

The findings have immediate implications for management and research priorities given the likelihood that fishery escapement counts of spawning adults in some northern rivers likely include fish that will succumb to premature mortality and fail to spawn.&nbsp; C<span>ontact&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/vanessa-von-biela?qt-staff_profile_science_products=0#qt-staff_profile_science_products">Vanessa&nbsp;<span>von</span>&nbsp;<span>Biela</span></a>, Anchorage, Alaska, for more information.</span>&nbsp;</p>

A new study&nbsp;analyzed polar bear diets in the southern Beaufort Sea during the springs of 2013&ndash;2016. The analysis estimated that the ice-obligate prey, ringed seal, remained the predominant prey species of SB polar bears (46.4%), with much lower consumption of bearded seal (19.6%), seabird (17.0%), bowhead whale (15.0%), and beluga whale (2.0%). Adult and subadult polar bear females appeared to depend more on the traditional ringed seal prey than adult and subadult males. Temporal trends were highly variable but did not show clear increases or decreases in proportional consumption of any prey species.

Studies of walrus diet have traditionally relied on examining the stomach contents of dead animals and are often limited in temporal and geographic resolution.

Results from the study are consistent with past diet studies and provides a first step in the use of a relatively new and powerful tool for accurate identification of walrus prey from samples collected non-invasively over vast areas that could yield much-needed information on shifts in walrus diet that may occur in a rapidly changing Arctic.&nbsp; (Contact: Sarah Sonsthagen, 907-786-7954, Anchorage, AK).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_xmsonormal\"><span>Sonsthagen SA, Jay CV, Cornman RS, Fischbach AS, Grebmeier JM, Talbot SL.

Results provide insights into the complex relationships between declining sea ice habitat and the foraging ecology of a threatened Arctic apex predator.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Citation: Katie&nbsp;<span>Florko</span>&nbsp;and others, 2020, Drivers and consequences of apex predator diet composition in the Canadian Beaufort Sea.&nbsp;<span>Oecologia</span>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-020-04747-0%C2%A0\">https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-020-04747-0&nbsp;</a></p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"","completed":"","followupvalue":"","id":2550,"users":[{"id":524,"name":"John Pearce","link":"/members/people/1446"}],"followup":null},{"milestone":204,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"December 18, 2020","shortdate":"12/18/2020","datevalue":"20201218","action":"<p><strong><a href=\"/members/events/15941\">Joint Health &amp; Well-being, Marine Ecosystems, and Coastal Resilience November 16 Meeting (Agenda, Notes, and Recording)</a></strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span>Topic</span><span>: Sharing Environmental Observations from 2020 and Implications for Food Security</span></li>\r\n<li><span>Presentations:</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"/members/documents/20062\"><span>Distributed Biological Survey 2020 Cruises-</span></a><a href=\"/members/tags/4301\"><span>Jackie Grebmeier&nbsp;</span></a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"/members/documents/20066\"><span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-138\">LEO</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>Network Food Security Related Observations</span></a><span>-<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href=\"/members/people/9841\"><span>Erica Lujan</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"/members/documents/20061\"><span>AAOKH Food Security Related Observations</span></a><span>-<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href=\"/members/people/11901\"><span>Donna Hauser</span></a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"/members/documents/20067\"><span>Bering Strait Food Security Related Observations</span></a><span>-<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href=\"/members/people/4166\"><span>Gay Sheffield</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><span>Indigenous Sentinels Network-<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href=\"/members/people/14129\"><span>Lauren Divine</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><span>Community food security perspective- Charlene Apok</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><span>Highlight</span><span>:<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>The objectives of this webinar was to hear updates of 2020 field observations from the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-67\">DBO</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>cruises relevant to food security, hear updates from local environmental observing networks to share 2020 observations, and hear local coastal community concerns with respect to food security this year.</span></li>\r\n<li><span>Relevant Links:&nbsp;</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-138\">LEO</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>Network:<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><a href=\"http://www.leonetwork.org/\">www.leonetwork.org</a></span></li>\r\n<li><span>Please add your email to this sheet, if you'd like to receive future AAOKH newsletters:<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U1r4WInMu3pmn8ZsCTXaYIjKzlFKewU2u9K06E27CmY/edit?usp=sharing\"><span>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U1r4WInMu3pmn8ZsCTXaYIjKzlFKewU2u9K06E27CmY/edit?usp=sharing</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><span>More information on the CoObs RNA at:<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/alaska.edu/rna-observations/\"><span>https://sites.google.com/alaska.edu/rna-observations/</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><span>Performance Elements:&nbsp;</span><a href=\"/members/milestones/2754\"><span>1.3.1</span></a><span>,<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href=\"/members/milestones/2758\"><span>4.3.1</span></a><span>,<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href=\"/members/milestones/2831\"><span>4.3.2</span></a><span>,<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href=\"/members/milestones/2782\"><span>4.3.3</span></a><span>,<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href=\"/members/milestones/2755\"><span>4.3.4</span></a><span>,<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href=\"/members/milestones/2741\"><span>8.1.1</span></a><span>,<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href=\"/members/milestones/2789\"><span>8.1.2</span></a><span>,<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href=\"/members/milestones/2809\"><span>8.2.1</span></a><span>,<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href=\"/members/milestones/2751\"><span>8.2.5</span></a><span><br /></span></li>\r\n</ul>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"12/18/2020","completed":"December 18, 2020","followupvalue":"20201218","id":2697,"users":[],"followup":{"text":["Completed","December 18, 2020"]}}];

Using data collected from three sites in Arctic Alaska, Alaska Science Center Wildlife Biologist Dan Ruthrauff and coauthors from the Wildlife Conservation Society and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service explored how shorebird breeding density, nest initiation, nest synchrony, nest survival, and potential phenological mismatch with prey resources varied between two exceptionally early (2015 and 2016) and late (2017 and 2018) springs. In general, birds bred earlier and in greater numbers but with less synchrony in warm, early springs compared to cold, late springs, observations that were consistent with predictions based on previous studies. Many results did not match predictions, however, and varied across sites in ways that lacked easy explanations, outcomes that underscored the importance of multi-site assessments involving long-term perspectives in addressing complex ecological relationships. Shorebirds in this study exhibited a high degree of behavioral flexibility in response to highly variable conditions at Arctic breeding sites, but whether this flexibility is sufficient to accommodate changes due to projected climate variation remains unknown.

Accelerating coastal erosion is one of the critical environmental changes occurring in the Arctic and is associated with intensifying wave climates driven by annual reductions in sea-ice extent. Alaskan Arctic erosion rates are accelerating, representing an increased source term of sediment and associated nutrients into the coastal ocean. We know relatively little about the pathways of sediment on Arctic continental shelves.

                <p></p><p>The National Science Foundation has recently awarded OPP – 1913195, 1912863. Accelerating coastal erosion is one of the critical environmental changes occurring in the Arctic and is associated with intensifying wave climates driven by annual reductions in sea-ice extent. Alaskan Arctic erosion rates are accelerating, representing an increased source term of sediment and associated nutrients into the coastal ocean. We know relatively little about the pathways of sediment on Arctic continental shelves. Arctic coasts are buffered by ice for up to nine months of the year and experience unique processes during breakup that can confound traditional seabed signatures of sediment accumulation. This project proposes to pair measurements of seabed properties with dynamic measurements of sediment fluxes within the water column during the storm season to determine the key mechanisms and pathways of sediment flux.

Understanding wave-ice-ocean interactions along the Arctic coast is essential to improving the skill of forecast and climate models in the region. The project will connect a rapidly changing climatology with the physical processes that are fundamental to Arctic coastal ocean, incorporating natural variability on a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. The investigators will apply recent progress in process-based modeling of coastal dynamics, provide detailed field observations along the coast for model validation and calibration, and generate a 20-year hindcast. The hindcast will then be used to investigate the climate signals in Arctic wave-ice-ocean coupling and determine: 1) the significance of coastal protection via scattering and dissipation of waves by sea ice; 2) the thermodynamic and mechanical effects of increasing wave energy; and 3) the changes in coastal flooding and circulation associated with increasing wave momentum. These results will fill a gap between the recent progress modeling wave-ice interactions in deep-water and existing programs studying erosion at the shoreline.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"10/15/2018","completed":"October 15, 2018","followupvalue":"20181015","id":1908,"users":[{"id":1080,"name":"Kate Ruck","link":"/members/people/4560"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","October 15, 2018"]}},{"milestone":236,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"August 27, 2019","shortdate":"8/27/2019","datevalue":"20190827","action":"<p><strong>Using Video Imagery to Study Wave Dynamics at&nbsp;Unalakleet, Alaska:</strong>The village of Unalakleet is established on a low-lying barrier spit at the eastern end of Norton Sound at the mouth of the Unalakleet River.

Accelerating coastal erosion is one of the critical environmental changes occurring in the Arctic and is associated with intensifying wave climates driven by annual reductions in sea-ice extent. Alaskan Arctic erosion rates are accelerating, representing an increased source term of sediment and associated nutrients into the coastal ocean. We know relatively little about the pathways of sediment on Arctic continental shelves. Arctic coasts are buffered by ice for up to nine months of the year and experience unique processes during breakup that can confound traditional seabed signatures of sediment accumulation. This project proposes to pair measurements of seabed properties with dynamic measurements of sediment fluxes within the water column during the storm season to determine the key mechanisms and pathways of sediment flux. Field data will be used to drive morphostatic and morphodynamic models of shelf profile evolution to determine feedbacks between wave propagation, erosion, and changes in the shelf profile over millennial timescales.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"9/17/2019","completed":"September 17, 2019","followupvalue":"20190917","id":2095,"users":[{"id":1080,"name":"Kate Ruck","link":"/members/people/4560"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","September 17, 2019"]}},{"milestone":236,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"November 25, 2020","shortdate":"11/25/2020","datevalue":"20201125","action":"<p><span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;A new Interdisciplinary Research for Arctic Coastal Environments (InteRFACE) project was launched by DOE BER in late 2019 that is developing the combined capabillity of modeling wave-sea ice interaction and landfast ice within the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) for seasonal to centential studies of the potential impact of a diminishing perennial sea ice cover as a coastal stressor.

&lt;p&gt;Laney, Samuel, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. &amp;ldquo;Riverine Carbon Contributions to Alaskan Arctic Coastal Margins&amp;rdquo;, funded under Carbon Cycle Science in&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-199&quot;&gt;ROSES&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;2016.

&lt;p&gt;This research seeks to better quantify the seasonality and variability in the riverine contribution of organic carbon into Arctic Ocean coastal margins. Rivers feeding the coastal Arctic Ocean drain several types of biomes and represent a major source of particulate and dissolved organic carbon (POC and&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-75&quot;&gt;DOC&lt;/abbr&gt;) to Arctic coastal margins. Climate-driven changes to Arctic terrestrial biomes will almost certainly alter the magnitudes and relative contributions of POC and&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-75&quot;&gt;DOC&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;that different rivers transport into their adjacent coastal oceans. Direct assessment of river-specific baselines for this terrestrial carbon input has been challenging because much of this carbon is delivered by the spring freshet that occurs while the coastal ocean is still covered by landfast sea ice. This project will examine the seasonality and magnitude of this carbon transport and its relationship to coastal hydrography and circulation, the spring freshet, seasonal ice dynamics, and remote sensing variables available during the freshet such as sea ice cover and ice morphology. This research involves a two-year observational study on the Alaskan Beaufort Shelf using bio-optical moorings and direct, through-ice monitoring to assess the magnitude and timing of riverine POC and&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-75&quot;&gt;DOC&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;contribution into the coastal Arctic. Six moorings will be deployed near Prudhoe Bay at the mouths of two rivers that drain terrestrial biomes with different vegetation and precipitation characteristics: the Kuparuk River which drains a primarily tundra biome, and the Sagavanirktok River which drains the coastal plain and the north slope of the Brooks Range. Sensors will measure optical proxies for POC and&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-75&quot;&gt;DOC&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;over two full annual cycles, most critically in the period encompassing the spring freshet when riverine transport of POC and&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-75&quot;&gt;DOC&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;is largest but when these coastal waters remain ice-covered and thus not yet directly observable by remote sensing. Monthly-scale field studies will be conducted in the late spring, immediately prior to the freshet, to deploy sensor clusters through the sea ice to directly measure these optical proxies over the course of the freshet until sea ice cover degrades and coastal waters become visible to remote sensors. These two observational efforts will generate unique and valuable time series of proxies for POC and&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-75&quot;&gt;DOC&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;as well as key environmental parameters related to coastal circulation, sea ice cover, and river discharge dynamics. These will be used in a subsequent analysis to quantify how the spatial and temporal evolution of riverine&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-75&quot;&gt;DOC&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;and POC injection by these two rivers relate to physical factors such as riverine seasonal flow and freshwater runoff, coastal hydrography and circulation, and importantly, seasonal sea ice cover. By examining two representative rivers that drain different types of terrestrial biomes, this study will provide insight into possible source-river differences in organic carbon transport into these seasonally ice-covered Arctic coastal margins. Having such direct, long-term observations of proxies for the POC and&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-75&quot;&gt;DOC&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;delivered by the spring freshet is essential for reducing uncertainties about key aspects of the organic carbon cycle on the Alaskan Arctic coastal margin: &amp;bull; What is the timing and magnitude of POC and&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-75&quot;&gt;DOC&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;injection into Arctic coastal margins? &amp;bull; How can autonomous systems help to assess differences in POC-&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-75&quot;&gt;DOC&lt;/abbr&gt;contributions by rivers that drain such different types of biomes (e.g., tundra vs. alpine)? &amp;bull; How do ice cover, hydrography, circulation, winds, and freshwater input affect the areal distribution of water column POC and&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-75&quot;&gt;DOC&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;on this shelf, during the freshet? &amp;bull; How might available remote sensing variables during this time of year be used to better understand similar riverine contributions of POC and&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-75&quot;&gt;DOC&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;more broadly across Arctic coastal margins in the Beaufort Sea and beyond?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Hernes, University Of California, Davis. &amp;ldquo;Impacts of estuarine processes on delivery of Arctic riverine materials to the near coastal environment:&amp;nbsp; Implications for water quality and biogeochemical cycling in Preparation for Arctic-COLORS&amp;rdquo;. Funded under Remote Sensing of Water Quality in&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-199&quot;&gt;ROSES&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental systems do not wait until it is convenient for humans to respond to perturbations, and a prime example of this is the rapidly changing Arctic that has science and policy scrambling to keep up. This highlights a critical need for programs such as&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;&#39;s Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-4&quot;&gt;ABoVE&lt;/abbr&gt;) and Arctic-COastal Land Ocean inteRactionS (Arctic-COLORS) that aim to characterize the extent of change to terrigenous and coastal systems in the Arctic, respectively, and the strength of associated feedbacks. However, it also highlights the issue of timing that these programs need to be fully implemented as quickly as possible for maximum impact on future policy decisions. The proposed research outlined here seeks to jumpstart Arctic-COLORS while filling major gaps in our understanding of the linkages between aquatic optical and biogeochemical properties and our knowledge about the transformation of inland water quality constituents from the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-4&quot;&gt;ABoVE&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;domain through estuaries to the near coastal environment. Our overarching goal is to use new and enhanced remotely sensed water quality observations to better understand biogeochemical fluxes and transformations across terrestrial-aquatic interfaces in the Arctic. Specifically, we propose to:1) Lay the foundation for Arctic-COLORS by establishing current baseline water quality conditions from the head of tides to the near coastal environment in two larger river systems (Yukon and Mackenzie Rivers) and a smaller river system on the North Slope of Alaska.2) Characterize the transformation of riverine material through estuarine gradients across different seasonal and hydrologic conditions in order to model delivery of materials to the near coastal environment from more than a decade of past river measurements from the Arctic Great Rivers Observatory (Arctic-GRO) dataset.3) Refine and develop algorithms for water quality concentrations from remote sensing data, which can then be used to hindcast coastal Arctic conditions back to 2002 and quantify the extent and rates of change in delivery of riverine materials to the near coastal environment. The validity of these hindcast values will be assessed through data synthesis efforts of past measurements and modeled exports as outlined in item #2.To link optics to aquatic biogeochemistry across the continuum of Arctic rivers, estuaries and the coastal ocean, we plan intensive field sampling on the Yukon River-delta for three transects in spring, early and late summer, acquisition of additional transect samples during similar flow regimes through our collaborators on the North Slope and Mackenzie River, and a period of continuous monitoring in the Yukon River. These study regions are part of both the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-4&quot;&gt;ABoVE&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;and Arctic-COLORS core study domains. In addition to the proposed new field observations, we will conduct a series of controlled salinity mixing experiments on samples from all three systems that will simulate transport through estuarine gradients during seasons in which we are not collecting transects. This is crucial for understanding the fate of terrigenous organic matter in the Arctic Ocean. Finally, we propose to synthesize existing bio-optical, hydrological and biogeochemical datasets in coastal and inland Arctic ecosystems collected as part of our prior work in the framework of Arctic-GRO and&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-4&quot;&gt;ABoVE&lt;/abbr&gt;, and through our proposed collaborations. These new and existing observations will allow us to develop new and refined remote sensing bio-optical retrievals and atmospheric corrections that will allow regional scaling and temporal hindcasting. Through the proposed integration of field sampling, satellite algorithm development, hindcasting, and synthesis efforts the proposed study will provide critical new knowledge of biogeochemical transformations across Arctic terrestrial-aquatic interfaces and an urgently needed link between the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-4&quot;&gt;ABoVE&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;and Arctic-COLORS field programs, both on the spatial and temporal domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manifestations of climate change in the Arctic are expected to include an intensified hydrologic cycle and thawing permafrost, with likely impacts on river discharge and associated constituents. Changes in the quantity and quality of water and carbon exported from terrestrial areas are expected as the Arctic undergoes a transition to a more groundwater-dominated system. The limited number of observations challenges our understanding of the magnitude and spatio-temporal variability in these exports, particularly for unmonitored rivers in northern Alaska.We will leverage available records of river discharge and surface soil freeze/thaw (FT) state from satellite data, and hydrological modeling to improve understanding of the temporal and spatial dynamics in freshwater export into coastal margins from the Yukon to Mackenzie (Y2M) Rivers. We will use remote sensing data sets for key spatially distributed geophysical quantities and will quantify interannual variability and the sign, magnitude, and significance of changes in freshwater export over recent decades. Our project will advance understanding of changes likely to occur as a result of declining frozen seasons, soil active layer deepening, permafrost thaw and hydrological cycle intensification. We will integrate multi-frequency satellite microwave remote sensing and other synergistic geospatial data using a novel machine learning Bayesian data fusion framework for probabilistic estimation of soil FT daily dynamics. We will develop a database of freshwater export across the western Arctic, focusing on export to coastal margins from the Yukon to Mackenzie rivers. We will merge available measurements with model simulated hydrography to derive exports in unmonitored areas. For areas lacking observed data our derived freshwater export time series will leverage a permafrost-hydrology model specifically adapted for studies of the terrestrial arctic water cycle. An ensemble of model simulations validated with gauge data from monitored rivers will be used to document uncertainties in export. Model simulations will make use of the growing collection of high resolution datasets being developed under&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;&#39;s Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-4&quot;&gt;ABoVE&lt;/abbr&gt;). Synergistic satellite data for FT timing, soil moisture, and surface water extent dynamics will be employed to constrain the process modeling. The project will advance mechanistic and predictive understanding of freshwater export with a central focus on physical processes operating within high latitude watersheds. This synthesis of data and models will advance understanding of how warming manifested through water cycle intensification and permafrost degradation is likely to impact terrestrial water and carbon exports to Arctic coastal areas.&lt;/p&gt;" data-action-deadline="" data-action-completed="9/4/2017" data-action-contacts="[{&quot;id&quot;:279,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Christine Mataya&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:&quot;/members/people/286&quot;}]">

Direct assessment of river-specific baselines for this terrestrial carbon input has been challenging because much of this carbon is delivered by the spring freshet that occurs while the coastal ocean is still covered by landfast sea ice. This project will examine the seasonality and magnitude of this carbon transport and its relationship to coastal hydrography and circulation, the spring freshet, seasonal ice dynamics, and remote sensing variables available during the freshet such as sea ice cover and ice morphology. This research involves a two-year observational study on the Alaskan Beaufort Shelf using bio-optical moorings and direct, through-ice monitoring to assess the magnitude and timing of riverine POC and<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-75">DOC</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>contribution into the coastal Arctic. Six moorings will be deployed near Prudhoe Bay at the mouths of two rivers that drain terrestrial biomes with different vegetation and precipitation characteristics: the Kuparuk River which drains a primarily tundra biome, and the Sagavanirktok River which drains the coastal plain and the north slope of the Brooks Range. Sensors will measure optical proxies for POC and<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-75">DOC</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>over two full annual cycles, most critically in the period encompassing the spring freshet when riverine transport of POC and<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-75">DOC</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>is largest but when these coastal waters remain ice-covered and thus not yet directly observable by remote sensing. Monthly-scale field studies will be conducted in the late spring, immediately prior to the freshet, to deploy sensor clusters through the sea ice to directly measure these optical proxies over the course of the freshet until sea ice cover degrades and coastal waters become visible to remote sensors. These two observational efforts will generate unique and valuable time series of proxies for POC and<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-75">DOC</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>as well as key environmental parameters related to coastal circulation, sea ice cover, and river discharge dynamics. These will be used in a subsequent analysis to quantify how the spatial and temporal evolution of riverine<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-75">DOC</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>and POC injection by these two rivers relate to physical factors such as riverine seasonal flow and freshwater runoff, coastal hydrography and circulation, and importantly, seasonal sea ice cover. By examining two representative rivers that drain different types of terrestrial biomes, this study will provide insight into possible source-river differences in organic carbon transport into these seasonally ice-covered Arctic coastal margins. Having such direct, long-term observations of proxies for the POC and<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-75">DOC</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>delivered by the spring freshet is essential for reducing uncertainties about key aspects of the organic carbon cycle on the Alaskan Arctic coastal margin: • What is the timing and magnitude of POC and<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-75">DOC</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>injection into Arctic coastal margins? • How can autonomous systems help to assess differences in POC-<abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-75">DOC</abbr>contributions by rivers that drain such different types of biomes (e.g., tundra vs. alpine)? • How do ice cover, hydrography, circulation, winds, and freshwater input affect the areal distribution of water column POC and<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-75">DOC</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>on this shelf, during the freshet? • How might available remote sensing variables during this time of year be used to better understand similar riverine contributions of POC and<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-75">DOC</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>more broadly across Arctic coastal margins in the Beaufort Sea and beyond?</p>

<p>Environmental systems do not wait until it is convenient for humans to respond to perturbations, and a prime example of this is the rapidly changing Arctic that has science and policy scrambling to keep up. This highlights a critical need for programs such as<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-155">NASA</abbr>'s Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (<abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-4">ABoVE</abbr>) and Arctic-COastal Land Ocean inteRactionS (Arctic-COLORS) that aim to characterize the extent of change to terrigenous and coastal systems in the Arctic, respectively, and the strength of associated feedbacks. However, it also highlights the issue of timing that these programs need to be fully implemented as quickly as possible for maximum impact on future policy decisions. The proposed research outlined here seeks to jumpstart Arctic-COLORS while filling major gaps in our understanding of the linkages between aquatic optical and biogeochemical properties and our knowledge about the transformation of inland water quality constituents from the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-4">ABoVE</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>domain through estuaries to the near coastal environment. Our overarching goal is to use new and enhanced remotely sensed water quality observations to better understand biogeochemical fluxes and transformations across terrestrial-aquatic interfaces in the Arctic. Specifically, we propose to:1) Lay the foundation for Arctic-COLORS by establishing current baseline water quality conditions from the head of tides to the near coastal environment in two larger river systems (Yukon and Mackenzie Rivers) and a smaller river system on the North Slope of Alaska.2) Characterize the transformation of riverine material through estuarine gradients across different seasonal and hydrologic conditions in order to model delivery of materials to the near coastal environment from more than a decade of past river measurements from the Arctic Great Rivers Observatory (Arctic-GRO) dataset.3) Refine and develop algorithms for water quality concentrations from remote sensing data, which can then be used to hindcast coastal Arctic conditions back to 2002 and quantify the extent and rates of change in delivery of riverine materials to the near coastal environment. The validity of these hindcast values will be assessed through data synthesis efforts of past measurements and modeled exports as outlined in item #2.To link optics to aquatic biogeochemistry across the continuum of Arctic rivers, estuaries and the coastal ocean, we plan intensive field sampling on the Yukon River-delta for three transects in spring, early and late summer, acquisition of additional transect samples during similar flow regimes through our collaborators on the North Slope and Mackenzie River, and a period of continuous monitoring in the Yukon River. These study regions are part of both the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-4">ABoVE</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>and Arctic-COLORS core study domains. In addition to the proposed new field observations, we will conduct a series of controlled salinity mixing experiments on samples from all three systems that will simulate transport through estuarine gradients during seasons in which we are not collecting transects. This is crucial for understanding the fate of terrigenous organic matter in the Arctic Ocean. Finally, we propose to synthesize existing bio-optical, hydrological and biogeochemical datasets in coastal and inland Arctic ecosystems collected as part of our prior work in the framework of Arctic-GRO and<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-4">ABoVE</abbr>, and through our proposed collaborations. These new and existing observations will allow us to develop new and refined remote sensing bio-optical retrievals and atmospheric corrections that will allow regional scaling and temporal hindcasting. Through the proposed integration of field sampling, satellite algorithm development, hindcasting, and synthesis efforts the proposed study will provide critical new knowledge of biogeochemical transformations across Arctic terrestrial-aquatic interfaces and an urgently needed link between the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-4">ABoVE</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>and Arctic-COLORS field programs, both on the spatial and temporal domain.</p>

<p>Manifestations of climate change in the Arctic are expected to include an intensified hydrologic cycle and thawing permafrost, with likely impacts on river discharge and associated constituents. Changes in the quantity and quality of water and carbon exported from terrestrial areas are expected as the Arctic undergoes a transition to a more groundwater-dominated system. The limited number of observations challenges our understanding of the magnitude and spatio-temporal variability in these exports, particularly for unmonitored rivers in northern Alaska.We will leverage available records of river discharge and surface soil freeze/thaw (FT) state from satellite data, and hydrological modeling to improve understanding of the temporal and spatial dynamics in freshwater export into coastal margins from the Yukon to Mackenzie (Y2M) Rivers. We will use remote sensing data sets for key spatially distributed geophysical quantities and will quantify interannual variability and the sign, magnitude, and significance of changes in freshwater export over recent decades. Our project will advance understanding of changes likely to occur as a result of declining frozen seasons, soil active layer deepening, permafrost thaw and hydrological cycle intensification. We will integrate multi-frequency satellite microwave remote sensing and other synergistic geospatial data using a novel machine learning Bayesian data fusion framework for probabilistic estimation of soil FT daily dynamics. We will develop a database of freshwater export across the western Arctic, focusing on export to coastal margins from the Yukon to Mackenzie rivers. We will merge available measurements with model simulated hydrography to derive exports in unmonitored areas. For areas lacking observed data our derived freshwater export time series will leverage a permafrost-hydrology model specifically adapted for studies of the terrestrial arctic water cycle. An ensemble of model simulations validated with gauge data from monitored rivers will be used to document uncertainties in export. Model simulations will make use of the growing collection of high resolution datasets being developed under<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-155">NASA</abbr>'s Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (<abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-4">ABoVE</abbr>). Synergistic satellite data for FT timing, soil moisture, and surface water extent dynamics will be employed to constrain the process modeling. The project will advance mechanistic and predictive understanding of freshwater export with a central focus on physical processes operating within high latitude watersheds. This synthesis of data and models will advance understanding of how warming manifested through water cycle intensification and permafrost degradation is likely to impact terrestrial water and carbon exports to Arctic coastal areas.</p><p></p>

This project will examine the seasonality and magnitude of this carbon transport and its relationship to coastal hydrography and circulation, the spring freshet, seasonal ice dynamics, and remote sensing variables available during the freshet such as sea ice cover and ice morphology.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Principal Investigator Peter Hernes of University Of California, Davis is implementing research under the project &ldquo;Impacts of estuarine processes on delivery of Arctic riverine materials to the near coastal environment:&nbsp; Implications for water quality and biogeochemical cycling in Preparation for Arctic-COLORS&rdquo;. Funded under Remote Sensing of Water Quality in<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-199\">ROSES</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>2016. The proposed research seeks to jumpstart Arctic-COLORS while filling major gaps in our understanding of the linkages between aquatic optical and biogeochemical properties and our knowledge about the transformation of inland water quality constituents from the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-4\">ABoVE</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>domain through estuaries to the near coastal environment. Our overarching goal is to use new and enhanced remotely sensed water quality observations to better understand biogeochemical fluxes and transformations across terrestrial aquatic interfaces in the Arctic. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Principal Investigator Michael Rawlins, University Of Massachusetts, Amherst received<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\">NASA</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>funding for the proposal, &ldquo;Merging Satellite Data and Models to Investigate Soil Freeze-Thaw Dynamics Influencing Terrestrial Water and Carbon Exports from the Western Arctic&rdquo;. The project was funded under the Remote Sensing of Water Quality in<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-199\">ROSES</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>2016. The project will leverage available records of river discharge and surface soil freeze/thaw (FT) state from satellite data, and hydrological modeling to improve understanding of the temporal and spatial dynamics in freshwater export into coastal margins from the Yukon to Mackenzie (Y2M) Rivers. We will use remote sensing data sets for key spatially distributed geophysical quantities and will quantify interannual variability and the sign, magnitude, and significance of changes in freshwater export over recent decades. Our project will advance understanding of changes likely to occur as a result of declining frozen seasons, soil active layer deepening, permafrost thaw and hydrological cycle intensification.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the writing team completed the Arctic-COLORS scoping study/science plan report and submitted it to<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\">NASA</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>HQ program managers in February 2018.

Arctic Great Rivers Observatory (ArcticGRO) investigates how the chemistry and discharge of the Arctic's largest rivers are changing. The project focuses on the Arctic's six largest rivers; the Yukon and Mackenzie in North America and the Ob, Yenisey, Lena, and Kolyma in Siberia. Water samples are collected from each of these rivers six times per year and are analyzed for a wide variety of biogeochemical parameters. ArcticGRO also curates daily discharge data for these six rivers and has begun to gather and disseminate daily discharge data for nine additional rivers in the Russian Arctic. The watersheds of ArcticGRO's six primary rivers account for 67% of the pan-Arctic watershed area and, with the nine additional rivers in the Russian Arctic, ArcticGRO's coverage increases to 77% of the pan-Arctic watershed. Thus, ArcticGRO's water quality sampling and curation of river discharge data captures the vast majority of riverine inputs to the Arctic Ocean. All resulting data are freely available through ArcticGRO's website (arcticgreatrivers.org) and through the Arctic Data Center.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"9/17/2019","completed":"September 17, 2019","followupvalue":"20190917","id":2093,"users":[{"id":1080,"name":"Kate Ruck","link":"/members/people/4560"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","September 17, 2019"]}},{"milestone":187,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"November 25, 2020","shortdate":"11/25/2020","datevalue":"20201125","action":"<p>Lead Contact: Luis Tupas&nbsp;(<span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;USDA/NCRS&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:4737,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;10&quot;:0,&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Arial&quot;}\">USDA/NCRS)</span></p>\r\n<table xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" dir=\"ltr\" border=\"1\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;New SCAN site installed in Craig (southeast Alaska)&quot;}\">New SCAN site installed in Craig (southeast Alaska)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Continued Snow Survey sites collection and continual monitoring of many biometrics at SCAN, Tribal SCAN and SNOTEL sites&quot;}\">\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Continued Snow Survey sites collection and continual monitoring of many biometrics at SCAN, Tribal SCAN and SNOTEL sites</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The NRCS Snow Survey and Water Supply Forecasting (SSWSF) Program has 874\\nSNOTEL, 42 SNOLITE and 1,102 manual snow courses in the mountains across the western US\\nand Alaska.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Northwest Alaska is no stranger to large fall storms. From October until the sea ice arrives, the region experiences multiple coastal storms each year that heavily impact the region leading to inundation and coastal erosion. In September 2017, UAF deployed beach mounted tripods equipped with water level sensors in Kivalina, Shaktoolik and Shishmaref in an effort to gain a better understanding of the size, frequency and impact of these events on coastal communities. Custom made tripods were designed and built that could be transported to the remote communities and easily deployed in a days time. Tripods were deployed on the beach close to the last high tide line so that storms large and small could be recorded. The tripods housed HOBO MX2001 water level loggers that were programmed to record during storm events at a rate of one sample per second that provided water level data and a general picture of wave height and frequency over time. With the help of a local representative in each community, data was downloaded from the loggers after each storm and emailed to researchers at UAF. The 2017 project was a pilot study funded by AOOS and results will be posted on the AOOS oceanographic data portal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In September 2017, UAF deployed beach mounted tripods equipped with water level sensors in Kivalina, Shaktoolik and Shishmaref in an effort to gain a better understanding of the size, frequency and impact of these events on coastal communities. Custom made tripods were designed and built that could be transported to the remote communities and easily deployed in a days time. Tripods were deployed on the beach close to the last high tide line so that storms large and small could be recorded. The tripods housed HOBO MX2001 water level loggers that were programmed to record during storm events at a rate of one sample per second that provided water level data and a general picture of wave height and frequency over time. With the help of a local representative in each community, data was downloaded from the loggers after each storm and emailed to researchers at UAF. The 2017 project was a pilot study funded by AOOS and results will be posted on the AOOS oceanographic data portal.</span></p>

From October until the sea ice arrives, the region experiences multiple coastal storms each year that heavily impact the region leading to inundation and coastal erosion. In September 2017, UAF deployed beach mounted tripods equipped with water level sensors in Kivalina, Shaktoolik and Shishmaref in an effort to gain a better understanding of the size, frequency and impact of these events on coastal communities. Custom made tripods were designed and built that could be transported to the remote communities and easily deployed in a days time. Tripods were deployed on the beach close to the last high tide line so that storms large and small could be recorded. The tripods housed HOBO MX2001 water level loggers that were programmed to record during storm events at a rate of one sample per second that provided water level data and a general picture of wave height and frequency over time. With the help of a local representative in each community, data was downloaded from the loggers after each storm and emailed to researchers at UAF. The 2017 project was a pilot study funded by AOOS and results will be posted on the AOOS oceanographic data portal.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>https://www.aoos.org/alaska-water-level-watch/uaf-water-level-platforms/</span></p>","shortdeadline":"9/30/2017","shortcompleted":"9/28/2018","completed":"September 28, 2018","followupvalue":"20180928","id":1854,"users":[{"id":169,"name":"Molly McCammon","link":"/members/people/176"},{"id":973,"name":"Jacquelyn R Overbeck","link":"/members/people/4118"},{"id":2299,"name":"Nic Kinsman","link":"/members/people/7880"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","September 28, 2018"]}},{"milestone":171,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"September 28, 2018","shortdate":"9/28/2018","datevalue":"20180928","action":"<p><strong>The Alaska Water Level Meeting, Making Progress:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Alaska Water Level Meeting, Making Progress: Integrated Water Level Observation Network in Alaska was held in two sessions, Day 1. water level sensing technologies and Day 2. stakeholder and partner engagement.

The Alaska Coastal Mapping Strategy (Strategy) builds on decades of effort to modernize Alaska&rsquo;s geospatial infrastructure, including AMEC&rsquo;s creation in 2012, and envisions an Alaska that in 2030 possesses seamless coastal mapping data. AMEC, co-chaired by the U.S. Geological Survey and NOAA, recently completed the first statewide acquisition of terrestrial elevation data at consistent standards and specifications. With this achievement, there is now opportunity to channel momentum toward strategic mapping of Alaska&rsquo;s coasts and nearshore waters. New efforts to map the coast will meet critical needs for coastal mapping data, including bolstering the shipping and fishing economy through safer maritime navigation, ensuring more resilient coastal economies through flood and wave impact modeling, data-driven coastal infrastructure development, improved emergency planning, and more effective community management plans.&nbsp; More information at:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/user-engagement-office/alaska-mapping-executive-committee\">https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/user-engagement-office/alaska-mapping-executive-committee</a></p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"6/15/2020","completed":"June 15, 2020","followupvalue":"20200615","id":2394,"users":[{"id":952,"name":"Tracy Fuller","link":"/members/people/4017"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","June 15, 2020"]}},{"milestone":171,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"November 25, 2020","shortdate":"11/25/2020","datevalue":"20201125","action":"<p><span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Ice Detection Buoy (IDB) providing real time water column conditions leading up to freeze-up was prototyped and deployed in 2015 and provided real time data up through the freeze-up.
