This Inuit-led report illuminates the unique and rich Inuit values and management practices that have successfully safeguarded the Arctic for thousands of years.\n\nWe, Inuit, are at the forefront of the drastic changes taking place in the Arctic. As the world community increasingly turns its focus to the Arctic, it is important to ensure that Inuit Food Sovereignty is a priority in every context. This report links Inuit Food Sovereignty to holistic and adaptive management strategies that can ensure the food security, health, and well-being of Inuit throughout the Arctic for generations to come.\n\nThe legal systems summarized in the report were formed at a time when Indigenous Knowledge and Inuit management approaches were not given the respect and recognition they deserve by western cultures. For thousands of years, we have thrived in the Arctic. Our culture is rooted in values that shape the relationships we hold with everything within the Arctic ecosystem. Our values including respect, collaboration, and sharing all aid in supporting healthy and harmonious relationships and communities. These values are the core of our traditional management practices.\n\n Western management systems overlaid on top of traditional Inuit practices often take a different approach, sometimes grounded in historical discrimination. This report elevates our values, knowledge, and practices to bring forward the roles and perspectives of Inuit to support equity and food sovereignty.\n\n The report uses four case studies focused on walrus, char, beluga, and salmon as a lens to explore current management and co-management practices in Alaska and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region. The report further offers snapshots of important connecting components, such as climate change, the need for an ecosystem-based approach, the impacts of imposed borders, and the strength and resilience of Inuit culture.\n\n Throughout this work, the authors have emphasized the importance of law and policy reforms needed to capture the perspectives of Inuit. In addition, the interpretation and implementation of such law and policy must be understood in relation to how they support or impede our food sovereignty in a rapidly changing Arctic.\n\n All of the dimensions of self-determination related to management and co-management are reflected in the transformative recommendations offered by the contributing authors. These recommendations span across national and international realms. If implemented, the recommendations will support Inuit food sovereignty, holistic and adaptive decision-making, and the well-being of the entire Arctic.\n\nThis project was conducted in partnership with the  Eskimo Walrus Commission, the Inuvialuit Game Council, the Fisheries Joint Management Committee, the Kuskokwim River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, the Association of Village Council Presidents, Environmental Law Institute, and advised by ICC Canada. The report is a product of over 90 Inuit authors and a nine member Advisory Committee.\n\n This report will be of use to a broad spectrum of people. Inuit communities and co-management groups may use the reports to aid in communicating with those from outside their communities. Decision-makers, federal/state/territorial governments, academics, environmentalists, policy-makers, and industry may use the Final Report as a tool to enhance their understanding of the Arctic and to heighten Inuit Food Sovereignty.\n\n This report is accessible on our website at www.iccalaska.org. \n\nThe following link will take you directly to the report &amp;ndash; https://iccalaska.org/media-and-reports/inuit-food-security-project/\n\nThis work is supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1732373.

This Inuit-led report illuminates the unique and rich Inuit values and management practices that have successfully safeguarded the Arctic for thousands of years.<br><br>We, Inuit, are at the forefront of the drastic changes taking place in the Arctic. As the world community increasingly turns its focus to the Arctic, it is important to ensure that Inuit Food Sovereignty is a priority in every context. This report links Inuit Food Sovereignty to holistic and adaptive management strategies that can ensure the food security, health, and well-being of Inuit throughout the Arctic for generations to come.<br><br>The legal systems summarized in the report were formed at a time when Indigenous Knowledge and Inuit management approaches were not given the respect and recognition they deserve by western cultures. For thousands of years, we have thrived in the Arctic. Our culture is rooted in values that shape the relationships we hold with everything within the Arctic ecosystem. Our values including respect, collaboration, and sharing all aid in supporting healthy and harmonious relationships and communities. These values are the core of our traditional management practices.<br><br> Western management systems overlaid on top of traditional Inuit practices often take a different approach, sometimes grounded in historical discrimination. This report elevates our values, knowledge, and practices to bring forward the roles and perspectives of Inuit to support equity and food sovereignty.<br><br> The report uses four case studies focused on walrus, char, beluga, and salmon as a lens to explore current management and co-management practices in Alaska and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region. The report further offers snapshots of important connecting components, such as climate change, the need for an ecosystem-based approach, the impacts of imposed borders, and the strength and resilience of Inuit culture.<br><br> Throughout this work, the authors have emphasized the importance of law and policy reforms needed to capture the perspectives of Inuit. In addition, the interpretation and implementation of such law and policy must be understood in relation to how they support or impede our food sovereignty in a rapidly changing Arctic.<br><br> All of the dimensions of self-determination related to management and co-management are reflected in the transformative recommendations offered by the contributing authors. These recommendations span across national and international realms. If implemented, the recommendations will support Inuit food sovereignty, holistic and adaptive decision-making, and the well-being of the entire Arctic.<br><br>This project was conducted in partnership with the Eskimo Walrus Commission, the Inuvialuit Game Council, the Fisheries Joint Management Committee, the Kuskokwim River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, the Association of Village Council Presidents, Environmental Law Institute, and advised by ICC Canada.

&lt;p&gt;The principal investigator is Kristin Laidre of U of Washington and the project is entitled, &quot;Variability of Glaciers and Fjord Ice in Southeast Greenland with Application to Resident Polar Bears.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A summary of the project follows and more details will be provided in the next year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southeast Greenland, between approximately 60-68oN, contains 69 major tidewater glaciers that generally discharge into long, deep fjords covered by sea ice from fall to spring. These systems are undergoing rapid changes with a broad degree of spatial and temporal variability that is not well documented. Little is known about the intra-annual variability in Southeast Greenland glacier terminus position, calving patterns, and the interaction between the glacier, glacial malange and fjord sea ice. Addressing this gap in our knowledge is important from a glaciological perspective, and because the area is a specialized productive ecosystem. In particular, Southeast Greenland is host to a subpopulation of polar bears that is resident at glacier fronts year-round, hunting for seals on the floating ice malange and traveling inland on the glaciers themselves to reach adjoining fjords. Our project will answer key questions about Southeast Greenland glaciers, glacier-derived ice, and fjord sea ice. We will then use this information to link these physical characteristics of the environment to the behavioral patterns of the regional polar bear subpopulation. We will provide the first detailed characterization of Southeast Greenland glaciers at a roughly weekly resolution, including glacier advance and retreat time series, ice discharge, ice mAlange concentration and extent, and metrics of sea ice break-up, extent, and freeze-up. We will make use of multiple data sources including the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-367&quot;&gt;MEaSUREs&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Program (Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments), Landsat 8 optical imagery, sea-ice concentration from satellite passive microwave data, bathymetry from&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;&amp;rsquo;s Oceans Melting Greenland Program, data from&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;&amp;rsquo;s Operation IceBridge acquired over the glaciers of Southeast Greenland, and surface air temperature from coastal weather stations and from&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;&amp;rsquo;s&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-360&quot;&gt;MERRA&lt;/abbr&gt;-2 reanalysis product. Finally, we will use movement data acquired by satellite telemetry of more than 100 polar bears collared in Southeast Greenland from 2015 to 2017 to establish spatial habitat models for bears at glacier fronts and to quantify which features of glaciers are important to maintaining the subpopulation. The interdisciplinary nature of this science team enables the cross linkages between glaciology, sea ice, and ecology. Thiswork develops important cryospheric time series that will allow for an improved understanding of glacier/fjord interactions in a less-studied region of Greenland and at the same time elucidates the relationship between the physical environment and the resident polar bear subpopulation.&lt;/p&gt;

We used remotely sensed sea-ice concentration data for Baffin Bay, Canada, and satellite telemetry for adult female polar bears in the 1990s (n = 43) and 2000s (n = 38) to assess whether sea-ice habitat changes have influenced movements and habitat selection. Both the timing and availability of sea-ice habitat changed significantly between the 1990s and 2000s. Mean sea-ice concentration in June-October declined from 22 to 12%. Spring sea-ice retreat occurred 2 wk earlier and fall sea-ice advance 2 wk later in the 2000s. These changes translated directly to changes in habitat use by polar bears. In the 2000s, bears used significantly lower sea-ice concentrations in winter and spring. Also, bears were significantly closer to land in all months, except at the end of spring breakup when they remained on offshore sea ice as long as possible, likely to maximize foraging time prior to coming on land where they are largely food deprived. The presence of summer offshore sea ice facilitated broad movement of bears in the 1990s; however, this ice disappeared in the 2000s and resulted in significant declines in monthly movement rates. In the 2000s, adult females selected for lower sea-ice concentrations if they facilitated access to the continental shelf (&amp;lt;300 m). Our findings indicate that significant changes in available sea-ice habitat and habitat use in Baffin Bay have occurred since the mid-1990s and this subpopulation will likely experience negative population-level impacts related to a changing climate in the coming decades. In some other parts of the Arctic, such changes have preceded negative nutritional and demographic impacts.&lt;/p&gt;" data-action-deadline="" data-action-completed="10/4/2019" data-action-contacts="[{&quot;id&quot;:279,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Christine Mataya&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:&quot;/members/people/286&quot;}]">

&lt;p&gt;A summary of the project follows and more details will be provided in the next year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southeast Greenland, between approximately 60-68oN, contains 69 major tidewater glaciers that generally discharge into long, deep fjords covered by sea ice from fall to spring. These systems are undergoing rapid changes with a broad degree of spatial and temporal variability that is not well documented. Little is known about the intra-annual variability in Southeast Greenland glacier terminus position, calving patterns, and the interaction between the glacier, glacial malange and fjord sea ice. Addressing this gap in our knowledge is important from a glaciological perspective, and because the area is a specialized productive ecosystem. In particular, Southeast Greenland is host to a subpopulation of polar bears that is resident at glacier fronts year-round, hunting for seals on the floating ice malange and traveling inland on the glaciers themselves to reach adjoining fjords. Our project will answer key questions about Southeast Greenland glaciers, glacier-derived ice, and fjord sea ice. We will then use this information to link these physical characteristics of the environment to the behavioral patterns of the regional polar bear subpopulation. We will provide the first detailed characterization of Southeast Greenland glaciers at a roughly weekly resolution, including glacier advance and retreat time series, ice discharge, ice mAlange concentration and extent, and metrics of sea ice break-up, extent, and freeze-up. We will make use of multiple data sources including the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-367&quot;&gt;MEaSUREs&lt;/abbr&gt;Program (Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments), Landsat 8 optical imagery, sea-ice concentration from satellite passive microwave data, bathymetry from&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;&amp;rsquo;s Oceans Melting Greenland Program, data from&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;&amp;rsquo;s Operation IceBridge acquired over the glaciers of Southeast Greenland, and surface air temperature from coastal weather stations and from&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-155&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/abbr&gt;&amp;rsquo;s&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-360&quot;&gt;MERRA&lt;/abbr&gt;-2 reanalysis product. Finally, we will use movement data acquired by satellite telemetry of more than 100 polar bears collared in Southeast Greenland from 2015 to 2017 to establish spatial habitat models for bears at glacier fronts and to quantify which features of glaciers are important to maintaining the subpopulation. The interdisciplinary nature of this science team enables the cross linkages between glaciology, sea ice, and ecology. Thiswork develops important cryospheric time series that will allow for an improved understanding of glacier/fjord interactions in a less-studied region of Greenland and at the same time elucidates the relationship between the physical environment and the resident polar bear subpopulation.&lt;/p&gt;

We used remotely sensed sea-ice concentration data for Baffin Bay, Canada, and satellite telemetry for adult female polar bears in the 1990s (n = 43) and 2000s (n = 38) to assess whether sea-ice habitat changes have influenced movements and habitat selection. Both the timing and availability of sea-ice habitat changed significantly between the 1990s and 2000s. Mean sea-ice concentration in June-October declined from 22 to 12%. Spring sea-ice retreat occurred 2 wk earlier and fall sea-ice advance 2 wk later in the 2000s. These changes translated directly to changes in habitat use by polar bears. In the 2000s, bears used significantly lower sea-ice concentrations in winter and spring. Also, bears were significantly closer to land in all months, except at the end of spring breakup when they remained on offshore sea ice as long as possible, likely to maximize foraging time prior to coming on land where they are largely food deprived. The presence of summer offshore sea ice facilitated broad movement of bears in the 1990s; however, this ice disappeared in the 2000s and resulted in significant declines in monthly movement rates. In the 2000s, adult females selected for lower sea-ice concentrations if they facilitated access to the continental shelf (&amp;lt;300 m). Our findings indicate that significant changes in available sea-ice habitat and habitat use in Baffin Bay have occurred since the mid-1990s and this subpopulation will likely experience negative population-level impacts related to a changing climate in the coming decades. In some other parts of the Arctic, such changes have preceded negative nutritional and demographic impacts.&lt;/p&gt;" data-action-deadline="" data-action-completed="9/27/2018" data-action-contacts="[{&quot;id&quot;:279,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Christine Mataya&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:&quot;/members/people/286&quot;}]">

Minimizing other stressors such as trans-Arctic shipping, oil and gas exploration, and contaminants had a negligible effect on polar bear outcomes, although the model was not well-informed with respect to the potential influence of these stressors. Adverse consequences of loss of sea ice habitat became more pronounced as the summer ice-free period lengthened beyond four months, which could occur in most of the Arctic basin after mid-century if GHG emissions are not promptly reduced. Long-term conservation of polar bears would be best supported by holding global mean temperature to &le;2&deg;C above preindustrial levels. Until further sea ice loss is stopped, management of other stressors may serve to slow the transition of populations to progressively worsened outcomes, and improve the prospects for their long-term persistence.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><strong>Citation:</strong> Atwood, T.

Historically, polar bears (</span><em>Ursus maritimus</em><span>) of the SB have mostly remained on the sea ice year-round (except for those that came ashore to den), but recent changes in the extent and phenology of sea ice habitat have coincided with evidence that use of terrestrial habitat is increasing. We characterized the spatial behavior of polar bears spending summer and fall on land along Alaska's north coast to better understand the nexus between rapid environmental change and increased use of terrestrial habitat. We found that the percentage of radiocollared adult females from the SB subpopulation coming ashore has tripled over 15 years. Moreover, we detected trends of earlier arrival on shore, increased length of stay, and later departure back to sea ice, all of which were related to declines in the availability of sea ice habitat over the continental shelf and changes to sea ice phenology. Since the late 1990s, the mean duration of the open-water season in the SB increased by 36 days, and the mean length of stay on shore increased by 31 days. While on shore, the distribution of polar bears was influenced by the availability of scavenge subsidies in the form of subsistence-harvested bowhead whale (</span><em>Balaena mysticetus</em><span>) remains aggregated at sites along the coast. The declining spatio-temporal availability of sea ice habitat and increased availability of human-provisioned resources are likely to result in increased use of land. Increased residency on land is cause for concern given that, while there, bears may be exposed to a greater array of risk factors including those associated with increased human activities.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><strong>Citation:</strong> Atwood, T.

These systems are undergoing rapid changes with a broad degree of spatial and temporal variability that is not well documented. Little is known about the intra-annual variability in Southeast Greenland glacier terminus position, calving patterns, and the interaction between the glacier, glacial malange and fjord sea ice. Addressing this gap in our knowledge is important from a glaciological perspective, and because the area is a specialized productive ecosystem. In particular, Southeast Greenland is host to a subpopulation of polar bears that is resident at glacier fronts year-round, hunting for seals on the floating ice malange and traveling inland on the glaciers themselves to reach adjoining fjords. Our project will answer key questions about Southeast Greenland glaciers, glacier-derived ice, and fjord sea ice. We will then use this information to link these physical characteristics of the environment to the behavioral patterns of the regional polar bear subpopulation. We will provide the first detailed characterization of Southeast Greenland glaciers at a roughly weekly resolution, including glacier advance and retreat time series, ice discharge, ice mAlange concentration and extent, and metrics of sea ice break-up, extent, and freeze-up.

We used remotely sensed sea-ice concentration data for Baffin Bay, Canada, and satellite telemetry for adult female polar bears in the 1990s (n = 43) and 2000s (n = 38) to assess whether sea-ice habitat changes have influenced movements and habitat selection. Both the timing and availability of sea-ice habitat changed significantly between the 1990s and 2000s. Mean sea-ice concentration in June-October declined from 22 to 12%. Spring sea-ice retreat occurred 2 wk earlier and fall sea-ice advance 2 wk later in the 2000s. These changes translated directly to changes in habitat use by polar bears. In the 2000s, bears used significantly lower sea-ice concentrations in winter and spring. Also, bears were significantly closer to land in all months, except at the end of spring breakup when they remained on offshore sea ice as long as possible, likely to maximize foraging time prior to coming on land where they are largely food deprived. The presence of summer offshore sea ice facilitated broad movement of bears in the 1990s; however, this ice disappeared in the 2000s and resulted in significant declines in monthly movement rates. In the 2000s, adult females selected for lower sea-ice concentrations if they facilitated access to the continental shelf (&lt;300 m). Our findings indicate that significant changes in available sea-ice habitat and habitat use in Baffin Bay have occurred since the mid-1990s and this subpopulation will likely experience negative population-level impacts related to a changing climate in the coming decades. In some other parts of the Arctic, such changes have preceded negative nutritional and demographic impacts.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"9/27/2018","completed":"September 27, 2018","followupvalue":"20180927","id":1787,"users":[{"id":279,"name":"Christine Mataya","link":"/members/people/286"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","September 27, 2018"]}},{"milestone":192,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"October 2, 2018","shortdate":"10/2/2018","datevalue":"20181002","action":"<p><span>BOEM in partnership with USFWS has two long-term surveys used to determine seabird spatial distribution, species composition, and seasonal changes in species abundance in the Arctic on research vessels of opportunity.</span></p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"10/2/2018","completed":"October 2, 2018","followupvalue":"20181002","id":1880,"users":[{"id":338,"name":"Cathy Coon","link":"/members/people/786"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","October 2, 2018"]}},{"milestone":192,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"October 2, 2018","shortdate":"10/2/2018","datevalue":"20181002","action":"<p><span>BOEM&nbsp;fosters multi-discipline research in the Pacific Arctic to include influences of sea ice dynamics and advection on the phenology, magnitude and location of primary and secondary distribution and life history of upper trophic predators in response to availability of lower trophic prey resources; and improving knowledge about rates of consumption, growth, and reproduction of benthic and pelagic organisms.

In the 2000s, bears used significantly lower sea-ice concentrations in winter and spring. Also, bears were significantly closer to land in all months, except at the end of spring breakup when they remained on offshore sea ice as long as possible, likely to maximize foraging time prior to coming on land where they are largely food deprived. The presence of summer offshore sea ice facilitated broad movement of bears in the 1990s; however, this ice disappeared in the 2000s and resulted in significant declines in monthly movement rates. In the 2000s, adult females selected for lower sea-ice concentrations if they facilitated access to the continental shelf (&lt;300 m). Our findings indicate that significant changes in available sea-ice habitat and habitat use in Baffin Bay have occurred since the mid-1990s and this subpopulation will likely experience negative population-level impacts related to a changing climate in the coming decades. In some other parts of the Arctic, such changes have preceded negative nutritional and demographic impacts.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"10/4/2019","completed":"October 4, 2019","followupvalue":"20191004","id":2236,"users":[{"id":279,"name":"Christine Mataya","link":"/members/people/286"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","October 4, 2019"]}},{"milestone":192,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"October 4, 2019","shortdate":"10/4/2019","datevalue":"20191004","action":"<p><span>An annual report from<span>&nbsp;</span></span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\">NASA</abbr><span>'s principal investigator Kristin Laidre of U of Washington on her project entitled, \"Variability of Glaciers and Fjord Ice in Southeast Greenland with Application to Resident Polar Bears\" is expected in September 2019.

This Inuit-led report illuminates the unique and rich Inuit values and management practices that have successfully safeguarded the Arctic for thousands of years.\n\nWe, Inuit, are at the forefront of the drastic changes taking place in the Arctic. As the world community increasingly turns its focus to the Arctic, it is important to ensure that Inuit Food Sovereignty is a priority in every context. This report links Inuit Food Sovereignty to holistic and adaptive management strategies that can ensure the food security, health, and well-being of Inuit throughout the Arctic for generations to come.\n\nThe legal systems summarized in the report were formed at a time when Indigenous Knowledge and Inuit management approaches were not given the respect and recognition they deserve by western cultures. For thousands of years, we have thrived in the Arctic. Our culture is rooted in values that shape the relationships we hold with everything within the Arctic ecosystem. Our values including respect, collaboration, and sharing all aid in supporting healthy and harmonious relationships and communities. These values are the core of our traditional management practices.\n\n Western management systems overlaid on top of traditional Inuit practices often take a different approach, sometimes grounded in historical discrimination. This report elevates our values, knowledge, and practices to bring forward the roles and perspectives of Inuit to support equity and food sovereignty.\n\n The report uses four case studies focused on walrus, char, beluga, and salmon as a lens to explore current management and co-management practices in Alaska and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region. The report further offers snapshots of important connecting components, such as climate change, the need for an ecosystem-based approach, the impacts of imposed borders, and the strength and resilience of Inuit culture.\n\n Throughout this work, the authors have emphasized the importance of law and policy reforms needed to capture the perspectives of Inuit. In addition, the interpretation and implementation of such law and policy must be understood in relation to how they support or impede our food sovereignty in a rapidly changing Arctic.\n\n All of the dimensions of self-determination related to management and co-management are reflected in the transformative recommendations offered by the contributing authors. These recommendations span across national and international realms. If implemented, the recommendations will support Inuit food sovereignty, holistic and adaptive decision-making, and the well-being of the entire Arctic.\n\nThis project was conducted in partnership with the  Eskimo Walrus Commission, the Inuvialuit Game Council, the Fisheries Joint Management Committee, the Kuskokwim River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, the Association of Village Council Presidents, Environmental Law Institute, and advised by ICC Canada. The report is a product of over 90 Inuit authors and a nine member Advisory Committee.\n\n This report will be of use to a broad spectrum of people. Inuit communities and co-management groups may use the reports to aid in communicating with those from outside their communities. Decision-makers, federal/state/territorial governments, academics, environmentalists, policy-makers, and industry may use the Final Report as a tool to enhance their understanding of the Arctic and to heighten Inuit Food Sovereignty.\n\n This report is accessible on our website at www.iccalaska.org. \n\nThe following link will take you directly to the report &amp;ndash; https://iccalaska.org/media-and-reports/inuit-food-security-project/\n\nThis work is supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1732373.

These values are the core of our traditional management practices.\n\n Western management systems overlaid on top of traditional Inuit practices often take a different approach, sometimes grounded in historical discrimination. This report elevates our values, knowledge, and practices to bring forward the roles and perspectives of Inuit to support equity and food sovereignty.\n\n The report uses four case studies focused on walrus, char, beluga, and salmon as a lens to explore current management and co-management practices in Alaska and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region. The report further offers snapshots of important connecting components, such as climate change, the need for an ecosystem-based approach, the impacts of imposed borders, and the strength and resilience of Inuit culture.\n\n Throughout this work, the authors have emphasized the importance of law and policy reforms needed to capture the perspectives of Inuit. In addition, the interpretation and implementation of such law and policy must be understood in relation to how they support or impede our food sovereignty in a rapidly changing Arctic.\n\n All of the dimensions of self-determination related to management and co-management are reflected in the transformative recommendations offered by the contributing authors. These recommendations span across national and international realms. If implemented, the recommendations will support Inuit food sovereignty, holistic and adaptive decision-making, and the well-being of the entire Arctic.\n\nThis project was conducted in partnership with the  Eskimo Walrus Commission, the Inuvialuit Game Council, the Fisheries Joint Management Committee, the Kuskokwim River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, the Association of Village Council Presidents, Environmental Law Institute, and advised by ICC Canada. The report is a product of over 90 Inuit authors and a nine member Advisory Committee.\n\n This report will be of use to a broad spectrum of people. Inuit communities and co-management groups may use the reports to aid in communicating with those from outside their communities. Decision-makers, federal/state/territorial governments, academics, environmentalists, policy-makers, and industry may use the Final Report as a tool to enhance their understanding of the Arctic and to heighten Inuit Food Sovereignty.\n\n This report is accessible on our website at www.iccalaska.org. \n\nThe following link will take you directly to the report – https://iccalaska.org/media-and-reports/inuit-food-security-project/\n\nThis work is supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1732373.

This Inuit-led report illuminates the unique and rich Inuit values and management practices that have successfully safeguarded the Arctic for thousands of years.<br><br>We, Inuit, are at the forefront of the drastic changes taking place in the Arctic. As the world community increasingly turns its focus to the Arctic, it is important to ensure that Inuit Food Sovereignty is a priority in every context. This report links Inuit Food Sovereignty to holistic and adaptive management strategies that can ensure the food security, health, and well-being of Inuit throughout the Arctic for generations to come.<br><br>The legal systems summarized in the report were formed at a time when Indigenous Knowledge and Inuit management approaches were not given the respect and recognition they deserve by western cultures.

EFTs are essentially a top-down characterization of the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of ecosystem functioning (regardless of similarities or differences in ecosystem composition and structure), based on areas of the land surface that process energy and matter in similar ways, and potentially show coordinated responses to (and feedback effects on) environmental factors." Thus far, the project has focused on its first objective, "To develop and implement a processing stream for the production of Ecosystem Functional Types and Ecosystem Functional Diversity variables for the circumpolar arctic tundra."<span>&nbsp;</span></span><abbr data-qtip-content="acronym-188">PI</abbr><span><span>&nbsp;</span>and research team are recalculating the date of the maximum NDVI by 16-day composite and re-producing the comparison maps. In addition, they are working on code in Google Earth Engine which to calculate a Pearson’s correlation between the first three principal components and SD, Mean and Date of the Max, respectively, to quantitatively assess how well the PCs are explained by our existing statistics. They have started working on equations to calculate new relevant NDVI variables in Global Earth Engine, including: slope of greening up and browning, date of senescence, date of green up, and the length of the growing season. The team also is testing correlations of these new variables with the principal components. will also begin to investigate NDVI Statistics, PCs, and preliminary EFTs with circumpolar environmental predictors, including climate (precipitation, temperature, albedo), geology (soils, topography, permafrost presence and active layer depth) and land-use variables. Finally, the is investigating NDVI Statistics, Principal Components, and preliminary EFTs with circumpolar environmental predictors, including climate (precipitation, temperature, albedo), geology (soils, topography, permafrost presence and active layer depth) and land-use variables.</span></p><p></p>

These systems are undergoing rapid changes with a broad degree of spatial and temporal variability that is not well documented. Little is known about the intra-annual variability in Southeast Greenland glacier terminus position, calving patterns, and the interaction between the glacier, glacial malange and fjord sea ice. Addressing this gap in our knowledge is important from a glaciological perspective, and because the area is a specialized productive ecosystem. In particular, Southeast Greenland is host to a subpopulation of polar bears that is resident at glacier fronts year-round, hunting for seals on the floating ice malange and traveling inland on the glaciers themselves to reach adjoining fjords. Our project will answer key questions about Southeast Greenland glaciers, glacier-derived ice, and fjord sea ice. We will then use this information to link these physical characteristics of the environment to the behavioral patterns of the regional polar bear subpopulation. We will provide the first detailed characterization of Southeast Greenland glaciers at a roughly weekly resolution, including glacier advance and retreat time series, ice discharge, ice mAlange concentration and extent, and metrics of sea ice break-up, extent, and freeze-up.

Finally, we will use movement data acquired by satellite telemetry of more than 100 polar bears collared in Southeast Greenland from 2015 to 2017 to establish spatial habitat models for bears at glacier fronts and to quantify which features of glaciers are important to maintaining the subpopulation. The interdisciplinary nature of this science team enables the cross linkages between glaciology, sea ice, and ecology. This work develops important cryospheric time series that will allow for an improved understanding of glacier/fjord interactions in a less-studied region of Greenland and at the same time elucidates the relationship between the physical environment and the resident polar bear subpopulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:Loss of Arctic sea ice has implications for the distribution and population structure of ice-dependent species such as polar bears Ursus maritimus. We used remotely sensed sea-ice concentration data for Baffin Bay, Canada, and satellite telemetry for adult female polar bears in the 1990s (n = 43) and 2000s (n = 38) to assess whether sea-ice habitat changes have influenced movements and habitat selection. Both the timing and availability of sea-ice habitat changed significantly between the 1990s and 2000s. Mean sea-ice concentration in June-October declined from 22 to 12%. Spring sea-ice retreat occurred 2 wk earlier and fall sea-ice advance 2 wk later in the 2000s. These changes translated directly to changes in habitat use by polar bears. In the 2000s, bears used significantly lower sea-ice concentrations in winter and spring. Also, bears were significantly closer to land in all months, except at the end of spring breakup when they remained on offshore sea ice as long as possible, likely to maximize foraging time prior to coming on land where they are largely food deprived. The presence of summer offshore sea ice facilitated broad movement of bears in the 1990s; however, this ice disappeared in the 2000s and resulted in significant declines in monthly movement rates. In the 2000s, adult females selected for lower sea-ice concentrations if they facilitated access to the continental shelf (&amp;lt;300 m). Our findings indicate that significant changes in available sea-ice habitat and habitat use in Baffin Bay have occurred since the mid-1990s and this subpopulation will likely experience negative population-level impacts related to a changing climate in the coming decades. In some other parts of the Arctic, such changes have preceded negative nutritional and demographic impacts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" data-action-deadline="" data-action-completed="9/27/2018" data-action-contacts="[{&quot;id&quot;:279,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Christine Mataya&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:&quot;/members/people/286&quot;}]">

This proposal focuses on the planktonic lower trophic levels and will quantify the role that the mesozooplankton play in biological transformation and cycling of important elements (C, N) in the central Arctic Ocean ecosystem as part of the year-long Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition. Working together with an international team of scientists, the PIs will determine seasonal patterns in abundance, biomass, vertical distribution, and life stage structure for the entire zooplankton community using plankton nets and acoustic and optical methods.

These systems are undergoing rapid changes with a broad degree of spatial and temporal variability that is not well documented. Little is known about the intra-annual variability in Southeast Greenland glacier terminus position, calving patterns, and the interaction between the glacier, glacial malange and fjord sea ice. Addressing this gap in our knowledge is important from a glaciological perspective, and because the area is a specialized productive ecosystem. In particular, Southeast Greenland is host to a subpopulation of polar bears that is resident at glacier fronts year-round, hunting for seals on the floating ice malange and traveling inland on the glaciers themselves to reach adjoining fjords. Our project will answer key questions about Southeast Greenland glaciers, glacier-derived ice, and fjord sea ice. We will then use this information to link these physical characteristics of the environment to the behavioral patterns of the regional polar bear subpopulation. We will provide the first detailed characterization of Southeast Greenland glaciers at a roughly weekly resolution, including glacier advance and retreat time series, ice discharge, ice mAlange concentration and extent, and metrics of sea ice break-up, extent, and freeze-up.

Finally, we will use movement data acquired by satellite telemetry of more than 100 polar bears collared in Southeast Greenland from 2015 to 2017 to establish spatial habitat models for bears at glacier fronts and to quantify which features of glaciers are important to maintaining the subpopulation. The interdisciplinary nature of this science team enables the cross linkages between glaciology, sea ice, and ecology. This work develops important cryospheric time series that will allow for an improved understanding of glacier/fjord interactions in a less-studied region of Greenland and at the same time elucidates the relationship between the physical environment and the resident polar bear subpopulation.</p>\r\n<p><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-155\">NASA</abbr>-funded principal investigator Laidre also published the following paper in spring 2018.Kristin L.

(May 2018).Changes in winter and spring resource selection by polar bears Ursus maritimus in Baffin Bay over two decades of sea-ice loss. ESR vol 36:1-14. https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/esr/v36/p1-14/</p>\r\n<p>Abstract:Loss of Arctic sea ice has implications for the distribution and population structure of ice-dependent species such as polar bears Ursus maritimus. We used remotely sensed sea-ice concentration data for Baffin Bay, Canada, and satellite telemetry for adult female polar bears in the 1990s (n = 43) and 2000s (n = 38) to assess whether sea-ice habitat changes have influenced movements and habitat selection. Both the timing and availability of sea-ice habitat changed significantly between the 1990s and 2000s. Mean sea-ice concentration in June-October declined from 22 to 12%. Spring sea-ice retreat occurred 2 wk earlier and fall sea-ice advance 2 wk later in the 2000s. These changes translated directly to changes in habitat use by polar bears. In the 2000s, bears used significantly lower sea-ice concentrations in winter and spring. Also, bears were significantly closer to land in all months, except at the end of spring breakup when they remained on offshore sea ice as long as possible, likely to maximize foraging time prior to coming on land where they are largely food deprived. The presence of summer offshore sea ice facilitated broad movement of bears in the 1990s; however, this ice disappeared in the 2000s and resulted in significant declines in monthly movement rates. In the 2000s, adult females selected for lower sea-ice concentrations if they facilitated access to the continental shelf (&lt;300 m). Our findings indicate that significant changes in available sea-ice habitat and habitat use in Baffin Bay have occurred since the mid-1990s and this subpopulation will likely experience negative population-level impacts related to a changing climate in the coming decades. In some other parts of the Arctic, such changes have preceded negative nutritional and demographic impacts.&nbsp;</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"9/27/2018","completed":"September 27, 2018","followupvalue":"20180927","id":1786,"users":[{"id":279,"name":"Christine Mataya","link":"/members/people/286"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","September 27, 2018"]}},{"milestone":231,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"September 30, 2018","shortdate":"9/30/2018","datevalue":"20180930","action":"<p><span>The National Ocean Partnership program recently released the 2019 Broad Agency (#N00014-18-S-B007), which includes research opportunities for \"Sustained observations of marine biodiversity for improved understanding of marine ecosystem response to changing environmental conditions\".

Sampling included the Arctic Marine Biodiversity Observing Network (AMBON), The DIstributed Biological Observatory (DBO), and the turn-around of the Chukchi Ecosystem Mooring (CEO). The pandemic-related delays&nbsp;led to an unusual late-season cruise in October,&nbsp;and sampling indicated that the warmer conditions and delays in sea ice formation are supporting late season biological production that has not been commonly observed before.&nbsp;Aside from many samples taken to continue important time series, the cruise was also able to collect a unique set of samples for&nbsp;environmental DNA to detect new and changing organismal additions.&nbsp;In addition, sediments and benthic animals were collected to help document harmful algal blooms that are becoming increasingly observed in Arctic waters.&nbsp; Funding for the cruise was provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the North Pacific Research Board, and through the National Oceanic Partnership Program, which included funding from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.</span></span></p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"11/25/2020","completed":"November 25, 2020","followupvalue":"20201125","id":2637,"users":[{"id":997,"name":"Katrin Iken","link":"/members/people/4242"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","November 25, 2020"]}},{"milestone":231,"editable":false,"type":"outstanding","typeclass":"outstanding","date":"January 14, 2021","shortdate":"1/14/2021","datevalue":"20210114","action":"<p><span>USGS</span>&nbsp;and US Fish and Wildlife Service biologists in Alaska co-authored a recent paper evaluating potential changes in&nbsp;the&nbsp;distribution and arrival/departure dates of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/emperor-geese-near-kodiak\">emperor geese</a>&nbsp;to their wintering areas.

This Inuit-led report illuminates the unique and rich Inuit values and management practices that have successfully safeguarded the Arctic for thousands of years.\n\nWe, Inuit, are at the forefront of the drastic changes taking place in the Arctic. As the world community increasingly turns its focus to the Arctic, it is important to ensure that Inuit Food Sovereignty is a priority in every context. This report links Inuit Food Sovereignty to holistic and adaptive management strategies that can ensure the food security, health, and well-being of Inuit throughout the Arctic for generations to come.\n\nThe legal systems summarized in the report were formed at a time when Indigenous Knowledge and Inuit management approaches were not given the respect and recognition they deserve by western cultures. For thousands of years, we have thrived in the Arctic. Our culture is rooted in values that shape the relationships we hold with everything within the Arctic ecosystem. Our values including respect, collaboration, and sharing all aid in supporting healthy and harmonious relationships and communities. These values are the core of our traditional management practices.\n\n Western management systems overlaid on top of traditional Inuit practices often take a different approach, sometimes grounded in historical discrimination. This report elevates our values, knowledge, and practices to bring forward the roles and perspectives of Inuit to support equity and food sovereignty.\n\n The report uses four case studies focused on walrus, char, beluga, and salmon as a lens to explore current management and co-management practices in Alaska and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region. The report further offers snapshots of important connecting components, such as climate change, the need for an ecosystem-based approach, the impacts of imposed borders, and the strength and resilience of Inuit culture.\n\n Throughout this work, the authors have emphasized the importance of law and policy reforms needed to capture the perspectives of Inuit. In addition, the interpretation and implementation of such law and policy must be understood in relation to how they support or impede our food sovereignty in a rapidly changing Arctic.\n\n All of the dimensions of self-determination related to management and co-management are reflected in the transformative recommendations offered by the contributing authors. These recommendations span across national and international realms. If implemented, the recommendations will support Inuit food sovereignty, holistic and adaptive decision-making, and the well-being of the entire Arctic.\n\nThis project was conducted in partnership with the  Eskimo Walrus Commission, the Inuvialuit Game Council, the Fisheries Joint Management Committee, the Kuskokwim River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, the Association of Village Council Presidents, Environmental Law Institute, and advised by ICC Canada. The report is a product of over 90 Inuit authors and a nine member Advisory Committee.\n\n This report will be of use to a broad spectrum of people. Inuit communities and co-management groups may use the reports to aid in communicating with those from outside their communities. Decision-makers, federal/state/territorial governments, academics, environmentalists, policy-makers, and industry may use the Final Report as a tool to enhance their understanding of the Arctic and to heighten Inuit Food Sovereignty.\n\n This report is accessible on our website at www.iccalaska.org. \n\nThe following link will take you directly to the report &amp;ndash; https://iccalaska.org/media-and-reports/inuit-food-security-project/\n\nThis work is supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1732373.

For thousands of years, we have thrived in the Arctic. Our culture is rooted in values that shape the relationships we hold with everything within the Arctic ecosystem. Our values including respect, collaboration, and sharing all aid in supporting healthy and harmonious relationships and communities. These values are the core of our traditional management practices.<br><br> Western management systems overlaid on top of traditional Inuit practices often take a different approach, sometimes grounded in historical discrimination. This report elevates our values, knowledge, and practices to bring forward the roles and perspectives of Inuit to support equity and food sovereignty.<br><br> The report uses four case studies focused on walrus, char, beluga, and salmon as a lens to explore current management and co-management practices in Alaska and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region. The report further offers snapshots of important connecting components, such as climate change, the need for an ecosystem-based approach, the impacts of imposed borders, and the strength and resilience of Inuit culture.<br><br> Throughout this work, the authors have emphasized the importance of law and policy reforms needed to capture the perspectives of Inuit. In addition, the interpretation and implementation of such law and policy must be understood in relation to how they support or impede our food sovereignty in a rapidly changing Arctic.<br><br> All of the dimensions of self-determination related to management and co-management are reflected in the transformative recommendations offered by the contributing authors. These recommendations span across national and international realms. If implemented, the recommendations will support Inuit food sovereignty, holistic and adaptive decision-making, and the well-being of the entire Arctic.<br><br>This project was conducted in partnership with the Eskimo Walrus Commission, the Inuvialuit Game Council, the Fisheries Joint Management Committee, the Kuskokwim River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, the Association of Village Council Presidents, Environmental Law Institute, and advised by ICC Canada. The report is a product of over 90 Inuit authors and a nine member Advisory Committee.<br><br> This report will be of use to a broad spectrum of people. Inuit communities and co-management groups may use the reports to aid in communicating with those from outside their communities. Decision-makers, federal/state/territorial governments, academics, environmentalists, policy-makers, and industry may use the Final Report as a tool to enhance their understanding of the Arctic and to heighten Inuit Food Sovereignty.<br><br> This report is accessible on our website at www.iccalaska.org. <br><br>The following link will take you directly to the report – https://iccalaska.org/media-and-reports/inuit-food-security-project/<br><br>This work is supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1732373.

Working together with an international team of scientists, the PIs will determine seasonal patterns in abundance, biomass, vertical distribution, and life stage structure for the entire zooplankton community using plankton nets and acoustic and optical methods. Key biological rate processes of important species will be measured experimentally to determine seasonal changes in food web dynamics and to better understand life cycle and survival strategies and how they are linked to production cycle timing. Trophic linkages will be determined using both isotopic ratios and molecular techniques.

The results suggest that ringed and bearded seal body condition and the phase of the winter Arctic Oscillation are important factors affecting feeding, body condition and recruitment. Although spring sea ice declined 2% per year during the study, reaching levels not previously observed in the satellite record, reduced access to prey doesn&rsquo;t yet appear to have significantly affected body condition or reproduction.

We are addressing phenology and spatio-temporal patterns in primary production, secondary producers, and upper trophic level predators. The program consists of 2 components. 1. The Arctic Integrated Ecosystem Survey (AIES) led by NOAA conducted observations of oceanography, lower trophic levels, fish, and seabirds over the U.S. Chukchi Sea shelf from Bering Strait to Barrow during the late summer/fall of 2017 &amp; 2019. We are examining the physical and ecological factors that influence the distribution of fish. 2. The Arctic Shelf Growth, Advection, Respiration and Deposition Rate Survey (ASGARD) led by UAF conducted process studies of oceanography and lower trophic levels during late May-early June in 2017 and 2018 as sea ice retreated from the northern Bering and southern Chukchi Seas.

&lt;p&gt;In support of the Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO) project, visualization graphics based on satellite images and data have been posted and updated every week at https://earth.gsfc.nasa.gov/cryo/data/distributed-biological-observatory. Note that this link is new and replaces the old &amp;ldquo;neptune&amp;rdquo; website. The key data sets relevant to DBO that are provided by NASA/GSFC are: (1) Chlorophyll Pigment Concentration; (2) Sea Surface Temperature (SST); (3) Sea Ice Concentration; (4) Cloud Fraction; (5) Winds and Sea Level Pressure (SLP); (6) Sea Surface Salinity (SSS); and (7) Sea Surface Height Anomaly (SSHA). Color coded maps of weekly averages of the different parameters are provided for the pan-Arctic region with the new DBO study sites identified. Also, shown are animations of daily maps of sea ice cover superimposed with wind vectors showing how winds affects the changes in sea ice cover, as well as daily maps of surface temperature, Chlorophyll a concentration and cloud cover over a period of two weeks. Longer time series plots of average monthly values of the different parameters for the old DBO sites from 2000 to the present are also provided but additional plots will provided to show averages over the new DBO sites as well soon. Also, numerical values of the plots and the maps are available upon request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The link to the NASA DBO website is currently provided only by the NCAR/DBO website and attempts will be made to make sure that other websites associated with DBO, especially those at NOAA and NSF, provide the link to the NASA DBO website for higher visibility and utilization. Recent efforts also include a number of research projects focused on process studies as well as on improving the accuracy of available SSS, SST and Sea Ice Concentration data and doing validation studies of chlorophyll concentration as derived from MODIS data. The results of these efforts were published recently by reputable journals and publishers as indicated below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In support of the Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO) project, visualization graphics based on satellite images and data have been posted and updated every week at https://neptune.gsfc.nasa.gov/csb/index.php?section=270. The key data sets relevant to DBO that are provided by NASA/GSFC are: (1) Chlorophyll Pigment Concentration; (2) Sea Surface Temperature (SST); (3) Sea Ice Concentration; (4) Cloud Fraction; (5) Winds and Sea Level Pressure (SLP); (6) Sea Surface Salinity (SSS); and (7) Sea Surface Height Anomaly (SSHA). Recent efforts included a number of research projects focused on improving the accuracy of available data on SSS, SST and Sea Ice Concentration. The results of these efforts were published recently by major publishers and reputable journals as indicated below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Comiso, J. C., (2019) Climate Change and Sea Ice, International Encyclopedia of Geography, Wiley-AAG International Encyclopedia of Geography, doi: 10.1002/9781118786352.wbieg0568.pub2 (http://www.aag.org/encyclopaedia).&lt;br /&gt;Abstract: Global warming signals are observed in the atmosphere, land, ocean, and ice from multiple instrumental and paleoclimatic sources. Data indicate regional warming and changes in precipitation patterns. The heat content of the ocean up to 700 m in depth has increased significantly while the contrast between wet regions and dry regions over the oceans has increased over the past 60 years. Among the strongest signals of warming are those from polar regions where climate change is amplified and increases in temperature have caused significant changes in the timing of the melt season, retreats in the snow cover, loss of mass in ice sheet and glaciers, and thawing of the permafrost. But among the most dramatic changes observed on a global scale have been the rapid decline of the perennial and multiyear ice cover in the Arctic during the period 1979&amp;ndash;2017. Such decline can cause profound changes in the Arctic environment and the Earth&#39;s climate system.&lt;/p&gt;

Rigor (2019), Asymmetry in Surface Temperatures in the Polar Regions as Observed from Space, in &amp;ldquo;Taking the Temperature of the Earth,&amp;rdquo; ed. by Glynn Hulley and Darren Ghent, Springer, https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-814458-9.00005-8. &lt;br /&gt;Abstract: The Arctic currently provides some of the most visible indicators of climate change. The perennial sea ice cover has shrunk by &amp;gt; 50% in the last 35 years. Many glaciers have lost 40% of their volume during the last century, and the Greenland ice sheet has been losing mass at the rate of 250 gigatons/year. Warming is amplified by as much as three times in the Arctic compared to the global average, and the influence of enhanced surface temperature is manifested in the entire high-latitude region. This chapter describes the ability of satellite sensors to provide consistent basin-wide distribution of surface temperature in the Arctic region and vicinity. Satellite data provide insights into the actual spatial and temporal variability of surface temperature in the Arctic region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Garcia-Eidell, C., J. C. Comiso, E. Dinnat, L. Brucker, 2019, Sea Surface Salinity Distribution in the Southern Ocean as Observed from Space, J. Geophy. Res. Oceans, 124, https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JC014510.&lt;br /&gt;Abstract: Large‐scale spatial and temporal variabilities of sea surface salinity (SSS) in the Southern Ocean from 2011 to 2017 were studied using products derived from microwave sensors on board Aquarius, Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), and Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) satellites. Four products, three from Aquarius and one from SMOS, were evaluated and shown to be generally consistent within 0.3 to 0.6 psu and agree favorably with in situ measurements. However, although the Aquarius products show consistent seasonality of SSS with high values of 34.45 psu in October and low values of 33.40 psu in May, the SMOS and SMAP products lack such seasonal variations. This may be caused by larger uncertainties in the SMOS and SMAP data due in part to the lack of concurrent scatterometer measurements that is used to correct for roughness effects. The four products provide similar spatial distributions of SSS with root‐mean‐square difference from 0.25 to 0.58 psu. Differences among Aquarius products are mainly due to varying salinity retrieval algorithms, smoothing, and masking of sea ice, while the SMOS product showed the highest SSS deviation that is likely due to the bias‐adjustment done on the data set. Our analyses show that SSS in the Southern Ocean region has significant meridional variations with the lowest SSS near the ice edge and highest at lower latitudes. The SSS is also lowest in summer indicating the predominant influence of sea ice and glacial melt, but it stays low near ice edges even during the growth season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Garcia-Eidell, C., J. C. Comiso, E. Dinnat, and L. Brucker, (2017) Satellite observed salinity distributions in the Arctic J. Geoph. Res. Oceans, 122, doi :10.1002/2017JC013184.&lt;br /&gt;Abstract: Global surface ocean salinity measurements have been available since the launch of SMOS in 2009 and coverage was further enhanced with the launch of Aquarius in 2011. In the polar regions where spatial and temporal changes in sea surface salinity (SSS) are deemed important, the data have not been as robustly validated because of the paucity of in situ measurements. This study presents a comparison of four SSS products in the ice‐free Arctic region, three using Aquarius data and one using SMOS data. The accuracy of each product is assessed through comparative analysis with ship and other in situ measurements. Results indicate RMS errors ranging between 0.33 and 0.89 psu. Overall, the four products show generally good consistency in spatial distribution with the Atlantic side being more saline than the Pacific side. A good agreement between the ship and satellite measurements was also observed in the low salinity regions in the Arctic Ocean, where SSS in situ measurements are usually sparse, at the end of summer melt seasons. Some discrepancies including biases of about 1 psu between the products in spatial and temporal distribution are observed. These are due in part to differences in retrieval techniques, geophysical filtering, and sea ice and land masks. The monthly SSS retrievals in the Arctic from 2011 to 2015 showed variations (within 1 psu) consistent with effects of sea ice seasonal cycles. This study indicates that spaceborne observations capture the seasonality and interannual variability of SSS in the Arctic with reasonably good accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the visualization of the data has been improved and the enhanced data on SSS and Sea Ice Concentration have been made available for distribution at the NASA NSIDC DAAC.&lt;/p&gt;" data-action-deadline="" data-action-completed="" data-action-contacts="[]">

There are also many international DBO data collections being submitted to the ADC data archive, too, or via linkage of metafile data to national data holdings.</p><p></p>

These sampling locations are arrayed south-to-north and reflect a gradient of seasonal sea ice change and seawater warming. The investigators chose these 5 regions because they are zones of high biological productivity and biodiversity. Results so far indicate a freshening and warming of Pacific seawater which transits northward over the spring to fall season. These changes have impacted prey for larger marine mammals and seabirds. Satellite observations are also used to evaluate seasonal changes in sea ice concentration, surface seawater temperature, and chlorophyll concentration. The biological measurements focus on lower trophic levels and shipboard surveys of upper trophic level organisms. This research will increase our understanding of the impact of key environmental forcing parameters on biological change in the system.

Data indicate regional warming and changes in precipitation patterns. The heat content of the ocean up to 700 m in depth has increased significantly while the contrast between wet regions and dry regions over the oceans has increased over the past 60 years. Among the strongest signals of warming are those from polar regions where climate change is amplified and increases in temperature have caused significant changes in the timing of the melt season, retreats in the snow cover, loss of mass in ice sheet and glaciers, and thawing of the permafrost. But among the most dramatic changes observed on a global scale have been the rapid decline of the perennial and multiyear ice cover in the Arctic during the period 1979&ndash;2017. Such decline can cause profound changes in the Arctic environment and the Earth's climate system.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Comiso, J. C., D. Hall, and I.

Oceans, 124, https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JC014510.<br />Abstract: Large‐scale spatial and temporal variabilities of sea surface salinity (SSS) in the Southern Ocean from 2011 to 2017 were studied using products derived from microwave sensors on board Aquarius, Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), and Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) satellites. Four products, three from Aquarius and one from SMOS, were evaluated and shown to be generally consistent within 0.3 to 0.6 psu and agree favorably with in situ measurements. However, although the Aquarius products show consistent seasonality of SSS with high values of 34.45 psu in October and low values of 33.40 psu in May, the SMOS and SMAP products lack such seasonal variations. This may be caused by larger uncertainties in the SMOS and SMAP data due in part to the lack of concurrent scatterometer measurements that is used to correct for roughness effects. The four products provide similar spatial distributions of SSS with root‐mean‐square difference from 0.25 to 0.58 psu. Differences among Aquarius products are mainly due to varying salinity retrieval algorithms, smoothing, and masking of sea ice, while the SMOS product showed the highest SSS deviation that is likely due to the bias‐adjustment done on the data set. Our analyses show that SSS in the Southern Ocean region has significant meridional variations with the lowest SSS near the ice edge and highest at lower latitudes. The SSS is also lowest in summer indicating the predominant influence of sea ice and glacial melt, but it stays low near ice edges even during the growth season.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Garcia-Eidell, C., J. C. Comiso, E. Dinnat, and L. Brucker, (2017) Satellite observed salinity distributions in the Arctic J. Geoph. Res. Oceans, 122, doi :10.1002/2017JC013184.<br />Abstract: Global surface ocean salinity measurements have been available since the launch of SMOS in 2009 and coverage was further enhanced with the launch of Aquarius in 2011. In the polar regions where spatial and temporal changes in sea surface salinity (SSS) are deemed important, the data have not been as robustly validated because of the paucity of in situ measurements. This study presents a comparison of four SSS products in the ice‐free Arctic region, three using Aquarius data and one using SMOS data. The accuracy of each product is assessed through comparative analysis with ship and other in situ measurements. Results indicate RMS errors ranging between 0.33 and 0.89 psu. Overall, the four products show generally good consistency in spatial distribution with the Atlantic side being more saline than the Pacific side. A good agreement between the ship and satellite measurements was also observed in the low salinity regions in the Arctic Ocean, where SSS in situ measurements are usually sparse, at the end of summer melt seasons. Some discrepancies including biases of about 1 psu between the products in spatial and temporal distribution are observed. These are due in part to differences in retrieval techniques, geophysical filtering, and sea ice and land masks. The monthly SSS retrievals in the Arctic from 2011 to 2015 showed variations (within 1 psu) consistent with effects of sea ice seasonal cycles. This study indicates that spaceborne observations capture the seasonality and interannual variability of SSS in the Arctic with reasonably good accuracy.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, the visualization of the data has been improved and the enhanced data on SSS and Sea Ice Concentration have been made available for distribution at the NASA NSIDC DAAC.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"","completed":"","followupvalue":"","id":2139,"users":[],"followup":null},{"milestone":211,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"September 26, 2019","shortdate":"9/26/2019","datevalue":"20190926","action":"<p><a href=\"/members/events/12699\"><span>Marine Ecosystems August 28 209 Meeting</span></a><span> (</span><a href=\"/members/documents/14106\"><span>Agenda</span></a><span>, </span><a href=\"/members/events/12699\"><span>Notes (see comments)</span></a><span>, </span><a href=\"/members/events/12699\"><span>Recording</span></a><span>)</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Topic: </span><span>Field Season Updates and Surprises</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Presentations:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><a href=\"/members/documents/14146\"><span>Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO) 2019 Update</span></a><span>- </span><a href=\"/members/people/105\"><span>Jackie Grebmeier</span></a><span> (UMECS)</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span>All Arctic community members were invited to share field observations and surprises</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Highlights: Many updates from researchers noted highly unusual conditions observed in the field this season.

Recent efforts also include a number of research projects focused on process studies as well as on improving the accuracy of available SSS, SST and Sea Ice Concentration data and doing validation studies of chlorophyll concentration as derived from MODIS data. The results of these efforts were published recently by reputable journals and publishers as indicated below:</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Comiso, J. C.

&lt;li&gt;A framework for connecting Conventional Science and Indigenous Knowledge is presented in Moore and Hauser (in review).&amp;nbsp; Specifically,&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;we suggest that the strong seasonal cycle of Arctic environmental events should be adopted as a shared framework to foster CS-&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-407&quot;&gt;IK&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;communication when developing projects related to marine mammal health and ecology (from Abstract).&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp; The paper identifies the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;abbr data-qtip-content=&quot;acronym-67&quot;&gt;DBO&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;and the Alaska Arctic Observatory and Knowledge Hub (&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arctic-aok.org/&quot;&gt;https://arctic-aok.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks as at a stage of maturity where the framework could be trialled.&lt;/li&gt;

This Inuit-led report illuminates the unique and rich Inuit values and management practices that have successfully safeguarded the Arctic for thousands of years.\n\nWe, Inuit, are at the forefront of the drastic changes taking place in the Arctic. As the world community increasingly turns its focus to the Arctic, it is important to ensure that Inuit Food Sovereignty is a priority in every context. This report links Inuit Food Sovereignty to holistic and adaptive management strategies that can ensure the food security, health, and well-being of Inuit throughout the Arctic for generations to come.\n\nThe legal systems summarized in the report were formed at a time when Indigenous Knowledge and Inuit management approaches were not given the respect and recognition they deserve by western cultures. For thousands of years, we have thrived in the Arctic. Our culture is rooted in values that shape the relationships we hold with everything within the Arctic ecosystem. Our values including respect, collaboration, and sharing all aid in supporting healthy and harmonious relationships and communities. These values are the core of our traditional management practices.\n\n Western management systems overlaid on top of traditional Inuit practices often take a different approach, sometimes grounded in historical discrimination. This report elevates our values, knowledge, and practices to bring forward the roles and perspectives of Inuit to support equity and food sovereignty.\n\n The report uses four case studies focused on walrus, char, beluga, and salmon as a lens to explore current management and co-management practices in Alaska and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region. The report further offers snapshots of important connecting components, such as climate change, the need for an ecosystem-based approach, the impacts of imposed borders, and the strength and resilience of Inuit culture.\n\n Throughout this work, the authors have emphasized the importance of law and policy reforms needed to capture the perspectives of Inuit. In addition, the interpretation and implementation of such law and policy must be understood in relation to how they support or impede our food sovereignty in a rapidly changing Arctic.\n\n All of the dimensions of self-determination related to management and co-management are reflected in the transformative recommendations offered by the contributing authors. These recommendations span across national and international realms. If implemented, the recommendations will support Inuit food sovereignty, holistic and adaptive decision-making, and the well-being of the entire Arctic.\n\nThis project was conducted in partnership with the  Eskimo Walrus Commission, the Inuvialuit Game Council, the Fisheries Joint Management Committee, the Kuskokwim River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, the Association of Village Council Presidents, Environmental Law Institute, and advised by ICC Canada. The report is a product of over 90 Inuit authors and a nine member Advisory Committee.\n\n This report will be of use to a broad spectrum of people.

Photoacclimation of Arctic Ocean phytoplankton to shifting light and nutrient limitation. Limnology and Oceanography, 1-18. doi: 10.1002/lno.11039. The Arctic Ocean is becoming more and more ice-free during spring and summer, which, according to findings by Lewis et al. (2019) is shifting the limiting resource of phytoplankton growth from light to nutrients. This has had physiological consequences on phytoplankton, which were acclimated to grow under the high nutrient/low light levels found under the ice and create massive blooms beneath the sea ice. With less time to grow under sea ice, growth and photosynthetic rates are reduced due to severe nutrient limitation.&lt;br /&gt;Abstract: As the physical environment of the Arctic Ocean shifts seasonally from ice‐covered to open water, the limiting resource for phytoplankton growth shifts from light to nutrients. To understand the phytoplankton photophysiological responses to these environmental changes, we evaluated photoacclimation strategies of phytoplankton during the low‐light, high‐nutrient, ice‐covered spring and the high‐light, low‐nutrient, ice‐free summer. Field results show that phytoplankton effectively acclimated to reduced irradiance beneath the sea ice by maximizing light absorption and photosynthetic capacity. In fact, exceptionally high maximum photosynthetic rates and efficiency observed during the spring demonstrate that abundant nutrients enable prebloom phytoplankton to become &amp;ldquo;primed&amp;rdquo; for increases in irradiance. This ability to quickly exploit increasing irradiance can help explain the ability of phytoplankton to generate massive blooms beneath sea ice. In comparison, phytoplankton growth and photosynthetic rates are reduced postbloom due to severe nutrient limitation. These results advance our knowledge of photoacclimation by polar phytoplankton in extreme environmental conditions and indicate how phytoplankton may acclimate to future changes in light and nutrient resources under continued climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans. 123(11), 8004-8025. doi: 10.1029/2018JC014271&lt;br /&gt;Abstract: In seasonal ice zones (SIZs), such as the one of the Greenland Sea, the sea ice growth in winter and subsequent melting in summer influence the phytoplankton activity. However, studies assessing phytoplankton activities over complete annual cycles and at a fine temporal resolution are lacking in this environment. Biogeochemical‐Argo floats, which are able to sample under the ice, were used to collect physical and biogeochemical data along vertical profiles and at 5‐day resolution during two complete annual cycles in the Greenland Sea SIZ. Three phytoplankton activity phases were distinct within an annual cycle: one under ice, a second at the ice edge, and a third one around an open‐water subsurface chlorophyll maximum. As expected, the light and nitrate availabilities controlled the phytoplankton activity and the establishment of these phases. On average, most of the annual net community production occurred equally under ice and at the ice edge. The open‐water subsurface chlorophyll maximum phase contribution, on the other hand, was much smaller. Phytoplankton biomass accumulation and production thus occur over a longer period than might be assumed if under ice blooms were neglected. This also means that satellite‐based estimates of phytoplankton biomass and production in this SIZ are likely underestimated. Simulations with the Arctic‐based physical‐biologically coupled SINMOD model suggest that most of the annual net community production in this SIZ results from local processes rather than due to advection of nitrate from the East Greenland and Jan Mayen Currents.&lt;/p&gt;" data-action-deadline="" data-action-completed="" data-action-contacts="[]">

&lt;p&gt;The Nansen Legacy is a joint, concrete and ambitious plan to follow Nansen&amp;acute;s example in exploring the Arctic. To establish a holistic understanding of a changing Arctic Ocean and ecosystem, the project will provide the scientific knowledge base needed for future sustainable resource management in the transitional Barents Sea and the adjacent Arctic Basin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ice-free Arctic is gradually emerging. The winter sea ice retreat is to date most pronounced in the Barents Sea, the Atlantic gateway to the Arctic. As sea ice retreats and technology and infrastructure improves, it is imperative to rise to the scientific and exploratory legacy of Fridtjof Nansen and move poleward through the Barents Sea. The Norwegian Arctic research community, joint in the Nansen Legacy, will take on Nansen&amp;acute;s tasks with several approaches. First, through a number of multidisciplinary cruises, a holistic &quot;ground truth&quot; will be established for the physical environment and the ecosystem in the northern Barents Sea, and adjacent Arctic Basin. Secondly, there will be an assessment on the impact of human activities in this region, with an emphasis upon ocean acidification, pollution and the impacts of fisheries. Thirdly, using scientific models, a 2020-2100 outlook for the expected state of climate, sea ice, and ecosystem will be provided. This include development of multi-perspective scenarios for the northern Barents Sea developed by scientists and users in a 2050 perspective. Fourthly, in order to improve safety for people and commercial operations, improved polar weather forecasts will be developed. Fifthly, to ensure open data availability in accordance with national and international standards, the Nansen Legacy will improve, secure and operationalize national data archives. At last, most importantly, the core aspect will be the emphasis on recruitment and training of the next generation of cross-disciplinary Arctic researchers, and on engaging and educating the public.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>The Nansen Legacy is a joint, concrete and ambitious plan to follow Nansen´s example in exploring the Arctic. To establish a holistic understanding of a changing Arctic Ocean and ecosystem, the project will provide the scientific knowledge base needed for future sustainable resource management in the transitional Barents Sea and the adjacent Arctic Basin.</p>
<p>An ice-free Arctic is gradually emerging. The winter sea ice retreat is to date most pronounced in the Barents Sea, the Atlantic gateway to the Arctic. As sea ice retreats and technology and infrastructure improves, it is imperative to rise to the scientific and exploratory legacy of Fridtjof Nansen and move poleward through the Barents Sea. The Norwegian Arctic research community, joint in the Nansen Legacy, will take on Nansen´s tasks with several approaches. First, through a number of multidisciplinary cruises, a holistic "ground truth" will be established for the physical environment and the ecosystem in the northern Barents Sea, and adjacent Arctic Basin. Secondly, there will be an assessment on the impact of human activities in this region, with an emphasis upon ocean acidification, pollution and the impacts of fisheries. Thirdly, using scientific models, a 2020-2100 outlook for the expected state of climate, sea ice, and ecosystem will be provided. This include development of multi-perspective scenarios for the northern Barents Sea developed by scientists and users in a 2050 perspective. Fourthly, in order to improve safety for people and commercial operations, improved polar weather forecasts will be developed. Fifthly, to ensure open data availability in accordance with national and international standards, the Nansen Legacy will improve, secure and operationalize national data archives. At last, most importantly, the core aspect will be the emphasis on recruitment and training of the next generation of cross-disciplinary Arctic researchers, and on engaging and educating the public.</p>

The winter sea ice retreat is to date most pronounced in the Barents Sea, the Atlantic gateway to the Arctic. As sea ice retreats and technology and infrastructure improves, it is imperative to rise to the scientific and exploratory legacy of Fridtjof Nansen and move poleward through the Barents Sea. The Norwegian Arctic research community, joint in the Nansen Legacy, will take on Nansen&acute;s tasks with several approaches. First, through a number of multidisciplinary cruises, a holistic \"ground truth\" will be established for the physical environment and the ecosystem in the northern Barents Sea, and adjacent Arctic Basin. Secondly, there will be an assessment on the impact of human activities in this region, with an emphasis upon ocean acidification, pollution and the impacts of fisheries. Thirdly, using scientific models, a 2020-2100 outlook for the expected state of climate, sea ice, and ecosystem will be provided. This include development of multi-perspective scenarios for the northern Barents Sea developed by scientists and users in a 2050 perspective. Fourthly, in order to improve safety for people and commercial operations, improved polar weather forecasts will be developed. Fifthly, to ensure open data availability in accordance with national and international standards, the Nansen Legacy will improve, secure and operationalize national data archives. At last, most importantly, the core aspect will be the emphasis on recruitment and training of the next generation of cross-disciplinary Arctic researchers, and on engaging and educating the public.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span class=\"mute\"><br /></span></p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"4/12/2019","completed":"April 12, 2019","followupvalue":"20190412","id":1970,"users":[{"id":2937,"name":"Marit Reigstad","link":"/members/people/11881"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","April 12, 2019"]}},{"milestone":208,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"May 3, 2019","shortdate":"5/3/2019","datevalue":"20190503","action":"<p><span>The presentation given by Dr. Carin&nbsp;Ashjian&nbsp;(</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-295\">WHOI</abbr><span>) before the<span>&nbsp;</span></span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-414\">MECT</abbr><span>&nbsp;on May 24, 2019 was titled \"THE IMPACT OF SHELF BREAK UPWELLING ON BEAUFORT SHELF DISTRIBUTIONS OF ZOOPLANKTON AND FISH\".

These sampling locations are arrayed south-to-north and reflect a gradient of seasonal sea ice change and seawater warming.

Results so far indicate a freshening and warming of Pacific seawater which transits northward over the spring to fall season. These changes have impacted prey for larger marine mammals and seabirds.

Limnology and Oceanography, 1-18. doi: 10.1002/lno.11039. The Arctic Ocean is becoming more and more ice-free during spring and summer, which, according to findings by Lewis et al. (2019) is shifting the limiting resource of phytoplankton growth from light to nutrients. This has had physiological consequences on phytoplankton, which were acclimated to grow under the high nutrient/low light levels found under the ice and create massive blooms beneath the sea ice. With less time to grow under sea ice, growth and photosynthetic rates are reduced due to severe nutrient limitation.<br />Abstract: As the physical environment of the Arctic Ocean shifts seasonally from ice‐covered to open water, the limiting resource for phytoplankton growth shifts from light to nutrients. To understand the phytoplankton photophysiological responses to these environmental changes, we evaluated photoacclimation strategies of phytoplankton during the low‐light, high‐nutrient, ice‐covered spring and the high‐light, low‐nutrient, ice‐free summer. Field results show that phytoplankton effectively acclimated to reduced irradiance beneath the sea ice by maximizing light absorption and photosynthetic capacity. In fact, exceptionally high maximum photosynthetic rates and efficiency observed during the spring demonstrate that abundant nutrients enable prebloom phytoplankton to become &ldquo;primed&rdquo; for increases in irradiance. This ability to quickly exploit increasing irradiance can help explain the ability of phytoplankton to generate massive blooms beneath sea ice. In comparison, phytoplankton growth and photosynthetic rates are reduced postbloom due to severe nutrient limitation. These results advance our knowledge of photoacclimation by polar phytoplankton in extreme environmental conditions and indicate how phytoplankton may acclimate to future changes in light and nutrient resources under continued climate change.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Mayot, N., Matrai, P., Ellingsen, I.

Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans. 123(11), 8004-8025. doi: 10.1029/2018JC014271<br />Abstract: In seasonal ice zones (SIZs), such as the one of the Greenland Sea, the sea ice growth in winter and subsequent melting in summer influence the phytoplankton activity. However, studies assessing phytoplankton activities over complete annual cycles and at a fine temporal resolution are lacking in this environment. Biogeochemical‐Argo floats, which are able to sample under the ice, were used to collect physical and biogeochemical data along vertical profiles and at 5‐day resolution during two complete annual cycles in the Greenland Sea SIZ. Three phytoplankton activity phases were distinct within an annual cycle: one under ice, a second at the ice edge, and a third one around an open‐water subsurface chlorophyll maximum. As expected, the light and nitrate availabilities controlled the phytoplankton activity and the establishment of these phases. On average, most of the annual net community production occurred equally under ice and at the ice edge. The open‐water subsurface chlorophyll maximum phase contribution, on the other hand, was much smaller. Phytoplankton biomass accumulation and production thus occur over a longer period than might be assumed if under ice blooms were neglected. This also means that satellite‐based estimates of phytoplankton biomass and production in this SIZ are likely underestimated.

This project is aimed at characterizing patterns of phytoplankton growth and how they might be influenced by Arctic change. While many aspects of Arctic system responses to warming can be monitored remotely with satellites or moored sensors, observations of integrated ocean ecosystem response have historically been less tractable to obtain at needed scales. This observing gap is a hindrance to understanding and modeling the potential implications of physical system change for carbon and energy flows through Arctic ecosystems, and to understanding how biologically-facilitated exchange of carbon between atmosphere and ocean might change in the future. This project will directly address this observing gap. A high-resolution dissolved gas tracer approach (O2/Ar) will be used to constrain rates of net community productivity (NCP) throughout the Pacific-influenced Arctic on ships of opportunity.

The results suggest that ringed and bearded seal body condition and the phase of the winter Arctic Oscillation are important factors affecting feeding, body condition and recruitment. Although spring sea ice declined 2% per year during the study, reaching levels not previously observed in the satellite record, reduced access to prey doesn&rsquo;t yet appear to have significantly affected body condition or reproduction.

The investigators will establish and analyze a multi-decadal baseline of observations that describes the spatial distributions of planktonic communities in the western Arctic Ocean with the goal of developing optical tools and approaches that can be broadly applied to understand future environmental change in the region. Activities include a combination of (i) field work in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas through collaboration with a Japanese research program, (ii) the development of optically-based algorithms for discerning planktonic community assemblages, and (iii) application of these algorithms to satellite remote-sensing data. The field work will include observations of planktonic community structure and connect these to seawater optical properties in the study area at different seasonal time periods. In addition, the investigators will use phytoplankton pigment measurements to infer spatial patterns of planktonic community composition and address the hypothesis that optical measurements can identify distinct planktonic assemblages. Finally, the project will develop and validate algorithms relating seawater optical properties to planktonic community structure and apply these to a time series of ocean color imagery to generate spatial maps of plankton community composition within the surface ocean.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"10/15/2018","completed":"October 15, 2018","followupvalue":"20181015","id":1912,"users":[{"id":1080,"name":"Kate Ruck","link":"/members/people/4560"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","October 15, 2018"]}},{"milestone":190,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"October 23, 2018","shortdate":"10/23/2018","datevalue":"20181023","action":"<p><span>Dr<span>&nbsp;<a href=\"/members/people/11100\">Manfredi Manizza</a></span></span><span>'s</span><span>&nbsp;presented his past and current research at the 3/21/2018<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-414\">MECT</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span>call.

The investigators will establish and analyze a multi-decadal baseline of observations that describes the spatial distributions of planktonic communities in the western Arctic Ocean with the goal of developing optical tools and approaches that can be broadly applied to understand future environmental change in the region. Activities include a combination of (i) field work in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas through collaboration with a Japanese research program, (ii) the development of optically-based algorithms for discerning planktonic community assemblages, and (iii) application of these algorithms to satellite remote-sensing data. The field work will include observations of planktonic community structure and connect these to seawater optical properties in the study area at different seasonal time periods. In addition, the investigators will use phytoplankton pigment measurements to infer spatial patterns of planktonic community composition and address the hypothesis that optical measurements can identify distinct planktonic assemblages. Finally, the project will develop and validate algorithms relating seawater optical properties to planktonic community structure and apply these to a time series of ocean color imagery to generate spatial maps of plankton community composition within the surface ocean.</p>","shortdeadline":"","shortcompleted":"10/15/2018","completed":"October 15, 2018","followupvalue":"20181015","id":1913,"users":[{"id":1080,"name":"Kate Ruck","link":"/members/people/4560"}],"followup":{"text":["Completed","October 15, 2018"]}},{"milestone":269,"editable":false,"type":"completed","typeclass":"completed","date":"November 11, 2019","shortdate":"11/11/2019","datevalue":"20191111","action":"<p><span><a href=\"/members/events/12787\"><strong>Marine Ecosystems October 24th Meeting</strong></a><strong><span>&nbsp;</span>(</strong><a href=\"/members/documents/15506\"><strong>Agenda</strong></a><strong>,<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><a href=\"/members/events/12787\"><strong>Notes (see comments)</strong></a><strong>,<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><a href=\"/members/events/12787\"><strong>Recording</strong></a><strong>)</strong></span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em><span>Topic:<span>&nbsp;</span></span></em><span>Model/Observation Integration Part 1</span></li>\r\n<li><em>Presentations:</em>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span><a href=\"/members/documents/15557\"><strong>Marine Biogeochemistry in the Coastal Arctic - White Paper</strong></a>-<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"/members/people/1815\">Clara Deal</a><span>&nbsp;</span>(<abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-230\">UAF</abbr>)</span></li>\r\n<li><span><a href=\"/members/documents/15562\"><strong>Modeling study to explore marine BGC in the Arctic in the next century</strong></a>-<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"/members/people/15561\">Keith<span>&nbsp;</span></a><a href=\"/members/people/15561\">Moore</a><span>&nbsp;</span>(UCI)</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><em><span>Highlights:</span></em><span><span>&nbsp;</span>At the<span>&nbsp;</span><abbr data-qtip-content=\"acronym-118\">IARPC</abbr><span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"/members/events/10676\">Modeling and Marine Ecosystems Collaborations team&rsquo;s joint meeting one year ago</a>, Georgina Gibson and Clara Deal presented the idea of the White Paper with the goal of motivating a workshop on observation and model integration of biogeochemical processes in the Arctic ocean regions.

The water depth was greater than 3500 m. The background noise levels in the frequency range from 1 Hz to 25 kHz were measured as part of a larger objective to determine direction and range to sources. Background noise spectral levels are presented for low and high floe-drift conditions. Tracking/characterization results for ice-cracking events (with signatures typically in the 10-2000-Hz band), including the initiation of an open lead within about 400 m of the array, and one seismic event (with a signature in the 1-40-Hz band).&lt;/p&gt;

The background noise levels in the frequency range from 1 Hz to 25 kHz were measured as part of a larger objective to determine direction and range to sources. Background noise spectral levels are presented for low and high floe-drift conditions. Tracking/characterization results for ice-cracking events (with signatures typically in the 10-2000-Hz band), including the initiation of an open lead within about 400 m of the array, and one seismic event (with a signature in the 1-40-Hz band).</p>
